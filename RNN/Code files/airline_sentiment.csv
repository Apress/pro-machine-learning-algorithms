1,@VirginAmerica Congrats VX on the new route! ‚úàÔ∏èüéâ
0,"@VirginAmerica I tried that. You offered to charge me an additional $1k for a new ticket or be stranded until Thurs. 1st time, last time."
0,"@VirginAmerica Never had a bad experience before, but this one took the cake. Now extortion for carry on items as well?"
0,@VirginAmerica Had to spend 5 hours worrying that items in carryon would be broken/stolen since I couldn't carry them on plane or lock bag.
0,"@VirginAmerica All of group E was told there was no more room in the bins. when I got on the plane, was room for at least 4 bags in my row!"
0,@VirginAmerica Thanks for making my flight from LAX to JFK a nightmare by forcing me to check my carry on bag at the gate. (1)
0,@VirginAmerica I have lots of flights to book and your site it not working!!!! I've been on the phone waiting for over 10 minutes..........
1,@VirginAmerica I am all about the in flight artisanal cheese and wine pairing.
1,@VirginAmerica That's classy.
1,@VirginAmerica I'm sure a lot of your 747 and 777 JFK-LHR flights go a lot faster than 513mph with a strong tailwind.
1,@VirginAmerica now it's just t-minus 32 minutes until my Elevate a Silver upgrade window opens . #FreeNeverSucks üòÉüëç
0,@VirginAmerica Why is it taking 12 years to fly home to Dallas? Get your shit together.
1,@VirginAmerica @JezzieGoldz would have been a rough trip but LUCKILY we were on a #virginamerica flight. #weather
1,"@VirginAmerica another perfect flight.   How come on your planes,  the sun visors can stay down?  Other carriers make you raise them?"
1,"Nice RT @VirginAmerica: The man of steel might be faster, but we have WiFi ‚Äì just saying. #ScienceBehindTheExperience http://t.co/FGRbpAZSiX"

1,@VirginAmerica Dad on Segway is the best part of this whole infographic!
1,@VirginAmerica Are there any plans for a short haul airline in Europe? Would defiantly fly with you guys :)
1,@VirginAmerica wifi AND better seating.
0,@VirginAmerica started my flight with a scolding for using an overhead bin that was then offered to the person seated next to me.
1,".@VirginAmerica not only was it great, but you return my calls the day after. Couldn't ask for more. #myVXexperience"
0,"@VirginAmerica While other airlines weren't Cancelled Flighting flights into BOS, and helping their customers get home, Virgin was saying Good luck!"
0,@VirginAmerica Grouping Virgin in with the others now. BOS weather has exposed their actual Cus Serv model. Never Flight Booking Problems with Virgin again!
0,"@VirginAmerica As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I'm shocked at Virgin's complete apathy toward their customers."
0,@VirginAmerica Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
0,@virginamerica Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)‚Ä¶tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees.
1,"@VirginAmerica so loyal that I'm driving to #NYC from #PA, to fly Virgin,  since you cut #Philly flights ;)"

0,@VirginAmerica my group got their Cancelled Flightlation fees waived but I can't because my ticket is booked for 2/18? Your reps were no help either üò°

1,@VirginAmerica Flying LAX to SFO and after looking at the awesome movie lineup I actually wish I was on a long haul.
1,@united thanks
1,@united Thanks for taking care of that MR!! Happy customer.
0,@united still no refund or word via DM. Please resolve this issue as your Cancelled Flightled flight was useless to my assistant's trip.
0,@united Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there's a long line for deicing... Still need to improve service #united
1,@united thanks -- we filled it out. How's our luck with this? Is it common?
0,@united Your ERI-ORD express connections are hugely popular .. now if only we could have an ERI-EWR hop! :)
0,@united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.
0,"@united Gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. If you have a way to PREVENT the constant issues, that would rock."
1,@united thanks
1,@united Thanks. It is on the same ticket.
0,@united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
0,@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
0,"@united I did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic, am I really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.Ridiculous!"
1,@united follow me please this airline is beautifull ‚ô•
0,"@united if the car seat is lost @united should just reimburse me for a new one, this is not a pair of shoes, it's a necessity for my child"
0,@united @highbuddyyy that totally sucks my cousin worked at PHL said @united
1,@united just wanted to let you know how wonderful Rosetta the gate agent was working flight 6457 Dan to Ase. Let her know she wasappreciated

0,"@United the internet is a great thing.  I am emailing executives in your company, maybe they will respond to me in a timely manner."
0,"@united thats weak. See ya üëã
Hey @VirginAmerica !!"
0,@united I flew back w other company since United didnt have an earlier flight
0,@united I am trying to book awards for September and need flights on @aegeanairlines but they will not show even w/ many award seats availab
0,@united I sure did.   I had to drive a total of 3 hours to get my own bag.  I'd like to explain that debacle but no one wants to talk to me.
0,"@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue."
0,@united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn't pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled
0,@united #Newarkliberty Airport need to indicate different gate#'s for terminals A&amp;C. #Flyingainteasy
0,"@united yes please! I am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting international flight! It seems so easy, but..."
0,@united How does United refuse to reissue a $400 lost voucher when their plane didn't take off due to mechanics? #badcustomerservice
0,"@united also during the run I was instructed to do, I shattered my computer. http://t.co/oAflfr7WXB"
0,"@united yes, we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice."
0,"@united iah to charlotte. Baggage claim rep latrice h. #customerservice non existent, Ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer"
1,"@united - thanks for your help...got me what I need, but its an issue with @_austrian . I guess I sit awhile longer."
0,@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
0,@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
0,@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
0,@United well sitting on the ground 'on time' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis

0,"@united No, I need you guys to not over book planes. It's not a concern, I'll just travel with someone else moving forward."
0,@united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable
0,@united When will email address/username sign-on be available? It's been a while.
1,@united Thank you for that. Am I able to claim any interim expenses or is the cost of the stuff up on me?
0,@united rude rude

0,@united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...
0,@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
0,@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
0,@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
0,@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
0,"@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told ""we can't find a supervisor."""
0,@united ZCC82U Cancelled Flight flight 16h in advance??? Need connect flight reschedule so the link isn't helping. Help!? Gf waited months to see me.
0,@united I will not be flying you again

1,@united I flew United last month and the experience was AWESOME!
0,@united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX.
0,"@united v upset with your disability  ""services"". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude."
0,@united thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.

0,"@united as a 1k, I'm always hoping for improvement."
0,@united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
0,@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.
0,@united mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each OS category.  It's expensive to get right .
0,@united another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come.
1,"@united 441, which also had 1 working WC in coach. Good thing this bird landed ahead of schedule. I have to use the WC stat."
0,"@united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you üò¢. I sincerely hope they can help me!!"
0,@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
0,@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
0,"@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it."
0,"@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did."
0,@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
0,@united Mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. Second time this week... Hmm.
1,@united for the record- Rozana at Newark was lovely and helpful. #choosekind
1,@united thx for update
0,@united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
0,@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
0,@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
0,@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA 236 LAS to IAD 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds!
1,@united despite my bag not making it to Newark good informative email tracking updates help!

1,"@united Wow. What a deal. Again, 30+ plus seats available. Easy change to make a customer happy."
0,@united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
0,@united Blackmailed me into paying ¬£130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
0,@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ‚úåÔ∏èout.
0,@united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08
0,@united it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail!
0,@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
0,@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
0,@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
0,@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
0,"@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one."
0,"@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench."
0,@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
0,@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
0,"@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,"
0,@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
0,@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
0,"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine."
0,@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
0,@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
0,@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
0,".@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service"
0,"@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better."
0,@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
0,@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
0,@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
0,"@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused"
0,@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
0,@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
0,@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
0,@united you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now
0,"@united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice"

0,"@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?"

1,@united another awesome new plane flight 1584 and extremely nice Captain Steve Connolly.
0,@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
0,"@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)"
0,@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
1,@united Every United flight between Saipan and Guam is an adventure! You never know when @CapeAir's old plane will be operational :)
0,@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
0,@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
0,"@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim"
0,@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
0,@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
0,@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
1,@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
0,"@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN"
0,@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
0,@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
0,"@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines"
0,@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
0,@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
1,@united thank you. Been trying for two days to set this up.
0,@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
0,@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
0,@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
1,@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer
1,@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
1,"@united this will definitely be a trip to remember EWR-STI second of the season, first on seat 35A because it pays to be loyal!"
0,"@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room..."
0,"@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!"
0,@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
0,"@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United."
0,"@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here."
0,@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
0,@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
0,@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
0,@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
1,@united you are one great airline ‚ù§Ô∏è
0,@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
0,@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
0,@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
0,@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
0,@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
0,@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
1,‚Äú@united: @MelanieSpring We'll see what we can do. ^KN‚Äù We are running! Most of this plane is running. Thanks for the help!
0,"@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!"
0,@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
0,@united plus what about food? And taxis?
0,@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
0,@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
0,@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
0,@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
0,@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
0,@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
0,"@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: ""Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."""
1,@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
0,"@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket."
0,"@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!"
0,@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
0,"Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier"
0,@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
0,@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
0,‚Äú@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN‚Äù I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
0,"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
0,@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
0,"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
1,"@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)"
0,@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
1,@united But thanks for asking
0,@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
0,@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
0,@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
0,"@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."
1,@united you too!
1,@united is my favorite airline.
0,@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
0,@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
0,@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
0,@united why would they make me share a room?
0,"@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway"
0,@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
0,@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
0,"@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
0,"@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please."
0,@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
0,@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
0,"@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"
1,@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe
0,"@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like"
0,@united flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city
0,"@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags."
0,"@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible ""provide a death certificate' policy"
0,@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
1,@united you guys continue to impress me in Houston. http://t.co/cIh1qNllcM
0,@United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you!
0,@united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW!
0,@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
0,@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
0,@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
0,@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
0,@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
0,@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
0,"@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!"
0,"@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."
0,"@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
0,@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
0,@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
0,@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
0,"@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool"
0,@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
0,@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
0,@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
0,@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
0,@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
1,@united Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! üôå #StatusMatchPaidOff http://t.co/ATfRKp6goY
1,"@united not just refunded, but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in DIA"
1,@united Thanks for the reminder. It's been a fun ride. http://t.co/pPVA4Rch9f
0,@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
0,@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
0,@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
0,"@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks"
0,@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
0,@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
0,"@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
1,@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
0,@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated‚Äîmy time wasted (2/2)
0,"@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?"
1,@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
0,@united That's correct‚ÄîI've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
0,@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
0,@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
0,@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
0,@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
0,@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
1,"@united despite shaky connections, looks like I'll get home tonight. Great job, @united - was touch and go for a while.."
0,"@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your control‚Äîthe price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn."
0,@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
0,@united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
0,@united GRK13575M is the file reference
0,@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
0,"@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably."
0,@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
0,@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
0,@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
0,"@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat"
1,@united thank you.
0,"@united: I don't care that a @thehipmunk link showed me a ""wrong"" price on your site‚Äîit's your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness."
0,"@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?"
0,‚Äú@united: @mllovelace The baggage fee is waived for Premier members. Please see http://t.co/u6Duw27mDE. ^JP‚Äù what's the point of membership?
0,@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
0,@united Dmed you. Thank you
1,@united thanks we'll be in touch!

0,"@united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story"
1,@united I left my comment with customer care. Thanks for contacting me.
0,@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.
0,"@united caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you've lost it at O'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating!"
1,Yes!! Thanks so much!!! üíú‚Äú@united: @whitterbug We see you spoke with our Reservations team and they've reinstated the flight. Thanks. ^EY‚Äù
1,"@united captain ""on behalf of the front office, welcome on board."".... Never heard that before. I laughed...hard.  #funnycaptain"
0,@united Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag?
1,@united These are great fares!!!!!
0,@united i left an item on the plane and have been calling non stop and no one has been answering can you please help
1,@united awesome I'll book my next Christmas vacatinn this December any other ways you want to devalue mileage plus.
0,@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
1,@United THANK U! Secured room for the night Thx to VERY helpful customer service rep N. Dorns.. I thanked her.. Can u 2? #goodenoughmother
0,@united where's my damn bag??
0,@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
0,@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
0,@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
0,@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
0,@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
0,@united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.
0,@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
0,@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
0,"@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example."
1,@united thank you. I flew into Newark from Vail/Eagle.
0,@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
0,@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
0,"@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle."
0,@united your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver
0,@united So you are inadequate by accident?
1,@united @reebok @rockinwellness @ Denver International Airport https://t.co/tKVmHBkeC3
1,@united Thank you for responding so quickly with a helpful tool! @dustyob
0,@united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN
0,@united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can't help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR
0,@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd
0,@united ...and when that doesn't work...
0,@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
0,"@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags."
0,@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
0,@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
0,@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage‚Ä¶ heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
0,"@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!"
0,@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
1,@united Thank you. Took care of everything and made it right. That's the experience I'm used to. Opened the app to find flight changed.
0,@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
0,"@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change"
0,@united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways
0,@United never heard of this? http://t.co/QDebyaHqfM
0,"@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious ""costs"" that you incur, @united?"
0,@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
0,@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
1,@united that's exactly the point. It fits. I'm premier access. Boarding group 2. This was a return ticket. I've been doing this for 15 yrs
0,@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
0,@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
0,"@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines"
0,@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
0,@united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver
0,"@united Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry."
1,@united Thank you!
1,@united My favorite way to travel! Thank you! http://t.co/vGN2X1ckg0
0,@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
0,@united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets?
0,"@united but if i tweet the ID number, won't that reveal my home address to anyone on the web?"
0,@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
0,@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
0,"@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i ""have"" to fly with you."
0,@united iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472
0,@united I did... no response back
0,@united this is atrocious customer service.
0,@united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
0,@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
0,@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
0,@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
0,@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
0,@united is the worst airline in the world.
0,@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
0,@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
0,"@united I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited"
0,@united I will but right now I'm to angry
0,@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
0,@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
0,@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
0,"@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around"
0,@united I think DM would be better
0,@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
0,@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
0,@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
0,@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
0,@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
0,@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
0,@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
0,@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
0,"@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude."
0,"@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines."
0,"@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people"
1,@united thank you
0,@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
0,"@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted."
0,@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
1,@united he has no priority and Iove it
1,@united Pleased to be a Premier Platinum
0,@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
0,"@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!"
0,@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley üòÉüòÉüòÉ
0,@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
0,@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
0,@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
0,@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
0,@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
0,@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
0,@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
1,Thank you ‚Äú@united: @TRUU_Tall I can certainly take a look. Please follow and DM me your confirmation number for assistance. ^JH‚Äù
0,@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER
1,@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
0,@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
0,"@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked."
0,@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
0,@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
0,@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
1,@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
1,@united Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile!
1,"@united I will, as soon as I am done with my article.  Thanks!  ~Tom"
0,@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
0,@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
0,@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
0,@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
0,"@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out."
0,@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
0,"@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep."
0,"@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!"
0,@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
1,@united Ok thank again for your help!
0,@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
1,@united flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time.
1,@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back.
0,@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
0,"@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD"
0,"@united This must be a drone ‚Äú@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you..."""
0,"@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though."
0,@united flight attendant doesn‚Äôt understand not understanding English doesn‚Äôt mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
0,"@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted."
0,@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
0,@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents üëø
0,"@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not"
1,@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
0,"@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay overnight?"
0,@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
0,"@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"
1,"@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just ""activate"" it and surf..."
0,@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
0,@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
0,@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
0,@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
0,@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
0,"@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!"
0,@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
0,"@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence."
0,@united yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/NfAQHhr09j
0,@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
1,@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp; beyond to get my stranded family home.
0,@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
0,@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
0,"@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints"
0,"@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?"
1,@united look at this beauty üòâ dc 10 united airlines üòâ http://t.co/MvYoizRPdE
0,@united Thanks! I'll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don't like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp; will be better
0,"@united, this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. http://t.co/tmccExYaaQ"
0,"@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent."
0,"@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?"
0,"@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
0,@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
0,"@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense"
1,@united ok thx!
0,@united go to hell
0,"@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed"
0,@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
0,"@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!"
1,@united great to hear Thankyou so much. Greatly appreciate your replies. Feel much more settled now.
1,@united counter agents at RDU deserve a medal. #thankyou
0,The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
0,@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
1,@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
0,@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
0,"@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse"
1,@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?
1,@united thank you for listening to my compliant and doing the right thing. I appreciate you working with me
0,@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
0,@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
0,@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
0,@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
0,@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
0,@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.
1,@united Great! I'm ready to go home.
1,@united wow you even answered back!  Awesome! @AmericanAir @USAirways That's customer service!!! #usairwaysfail
0,@united noooooooooooooooooooooope.
0,"@united Oh, we are sure it's not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it's usually the only YYJ flight that's Cancelled Flightled daily."
1,@united @JMS2802 : outsource it all United Airlines...your customers  are just loving you for it. Outsource. Outsource. Outsource.
1,@united Thank you! You need to follow back tho otherwise I can't DM you. X
0,"@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people"
0,@united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi.
1,@united Just sent! Thanks :)
0,@united already missed  connection ugh
0,"@united @JMS2802 : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft."
0,@united How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding &amp; I now lost my bag. Help!
0,@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info.
0,@united flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We're on the outdoor track for an hour
0,@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
0,@united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
0,@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
0,@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
0,@united that's not even an apology
0,@united that's cool - now what?
0,@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
0,"@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv"
0,@united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can't even take a walk without missing a change.
0,"@united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room"
0,"@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine."
0,"@united your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother?"
0,"@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING"

0,"@united
You really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake!"
0,"@united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to ""sick pilot"". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care."
0,@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member üòî
0,@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
0,"@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for ""maintenance"" it could be the same issue 2day"
0,"@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance""."
0,"@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight."
0,"@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out."
0,"@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags"
0,@united Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven't.

1,@united thank you!
1,@united Thanks for the update.
0,@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
0,@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
0,"@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details."
0,@united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again).
1,@united just confirmed a seat! Crisis averted! Beers won't be missed now
0,@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
0,@united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don't you fly to SBA? üò≠
0,@united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
1,@united Understood and thanks! I should have tried reaching out sooner.
0,@united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
0,@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
0,@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines
0,"@united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!"
1,@united The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. @seanMFmadden @PeterStraubMMA @jmercadoMMA @TonySimsMMA
0,"@united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!"
0,@united Ha‚Ä¶ you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
0,@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!

0,@united Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
0,@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
0,@united i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help!
0,@united you suck.    9 hour delay?!

0,"@united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes."
0,@united 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed!
0,@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
0,@united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
0,@united AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER!
0,@united still no response??
0,@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
0,"@united There is no ""reference number."" Your agent told me to ""just drive to the airport"" because ""I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."""
0,@united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
0,@united My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you.
0,@united my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed?

0,@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
0,@united passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines)
1,"@united been solved,  they finally picked up the second time I called,  thanks for the response JH!  7:21 to dulles works!"
0,"@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants."
0,@united space. Doctors' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united
0,@united 's new #flierfriendly is garbage. Just had to cry to get attendant to find a place for my medical supplies with limited overhead

0,@united i emailed the customer care via the website form. After a long wait Rachelle resolved my issue. But I'm still irritated w/ united.
0,"@united flight Cancelled Flightled,  and the updated one gets me into BWI too Late Flight! I'd be fine with DCA or IAD,  just arriving earlier!  Help!"
0,@united so is the ^JJ standing for Just Joking?  I am not finding the humor.

0,"@united you failed me last week at IAH. Next intl trip on Delta. Small ual flight from lax booked, that's it!"

0,@united how about starting without the robotic response?
0,"@united You can't control turbulence, but you can control customer experience, lot of scared people up here."
0,"@united Currently on UA862, 20 minutes of the worst turbulence I've ever experienced, and ZERO communication from the flight deck."
0,"@united yes, but it's not looking. The ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a Miami flight then to DR"

0,"@united No, thanks. I'm sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. I'm never flying United again."
0,@united current hold time AFTER speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long &amp; why not make this option available online?
0,@united I understand ppl make mistakes but don't code something in a way that we can't get reimbursed when it's YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE
0,@united also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection.

0,@united you need a bag bouncer. Get it together
0,@united @ShowExpert what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?

0,@united - it's been almost 2 weeks and still no word from DOT on update of london fare to us cities? any updates on your end?
0,@united well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change a flight
0,@united Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending.
0,@united no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house
1,@united have Michelle at T1 ORD train your other staff on how to treat customers. A refreshing pleasure to deal with.

0,@united an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from lax to bos with no reclining seat.... #lastflightwithyouever

1,@united thanks for the upgrade today great way to start my week! Cc: @CiscoJimFrench @cobedien
0,@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
0,@united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.

0,"@united Coach interior on UA 992 looked like it was salvaged from the 80s. Tiny unusable video, no power &amp; lifevests on the floor #UA992 ‚Ä¶"
0,@united Now about two dozen back in line to see a single CSR for reFlight Booking Problems final leg. (Kiosks on fritz.)
0,@united on plane to Newark now. I was checked in as Rebecca Levi. My bag is under her name too.
0,@united aaaand 7 hours Late Flightr won't be catching a flight til 6AM...stuck in at airport in a snowstorm with no hotel-how's that for patience?
0,@united @DelonGerry ual sucks
0,@united not happening.  Delta took care of us.  Peace!
0,BUT @united just re-booked to BOS; UGGH!! now 3 hour bus to WMASS home. Could have flown to BDL &amp; back to DC in same time. #unitedairlines
0,@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke
0,"@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue"
0,"@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (""uplink prob""). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?"
0,@United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United
0,"@united Yes I did.  We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you.  Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage."
0,"@united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!"
0,@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.
0,@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
0,@united I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1
0,@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz
0,@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
0,@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
0,@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
1,@united I wanna be grand staff
0,"@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."
0,@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
0,@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
0,@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
1,@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
0,"@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??"
0,@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
0,"@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?"
0,"@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ"
0,"@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don‚Äôt see that it has taken off yet"
0,@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
0,"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
0,"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
0,"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
0,@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
0,@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
0,@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
0,"@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united"
0,@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
0,@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
0,"@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx"
0,@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
0,@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
0,"@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded"
0,@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
0,"@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip."
0,@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
1,@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
0,"@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info."
0,@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
0,@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
1,@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
0,@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
0,"@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS"
0,@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
0,@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
0,"@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!"
0,@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
0,@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
0,@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
0,"@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away"
0,"@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error)."
0,@united it will be on a different airline.
0,@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
0,"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"
0,@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
0,@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
0,@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
0,"@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around."
0,@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
0,@united i need help but in spanish
0,"@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online"
0,@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
0,@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
0,@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
0,@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
0,"@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN"
0,@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
0,@united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
1,@united will do. Thanks for the help. Cheers
0,"@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA"
0,@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier
0,@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
1,@united I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let's make some good memories!
0,"@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)"
0,@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
0,@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
0,"@united I tried the online tracking and they said something like ""attempting to locate luggage"""
0,@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
0,@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
0,@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
0,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
0,@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
0,@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
0,"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"
0,@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
1,@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
0,@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
0,@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
1,@united it was delivered! Thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep!
0,"@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc."
0,"@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business."
1,‚Äú@united: Looking for a reason to travel? #quote http://t.co/GGuIg3t28z‚Äù
0,@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
0,@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
1,@united thank you!
0,@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
0,@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
0,@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
0,@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
0,@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
0,@united Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn
0,@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
0,@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
1,@united I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.
0,@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
0,@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
1,"@united Thanks! LOL! #UA6259 will wait for us. Per @flightaware, same tail number as #UA5525 :)"
0,@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
0,@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
0,@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
0,@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
0,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
0,@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
0,"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
0,@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
0,@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
0,@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
0,@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
0,@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
0,@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
0,@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from S√£o Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
0,@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
0,"@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option."
0,"@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484"
0,@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
0,@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
0,@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
0,@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
0,@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
0,"@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?"
0,"@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo."
1,@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
0,@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
0,@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
0,"@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent"
0,@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
0,@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
0,"@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this"
0,"@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there."
0,@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
0,@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
1,"@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!"
0,@united lol too little too Late Flight
0,@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
0,@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
0,@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
0,@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
0,@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
0,@united your seats are god awful.
0,@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner
1,@United Wanted to compliment ur phone agent Jeanette for reFlight Booking Problems RDU to SEA thru SFO after connecting flight thru EWR was Cancelled Flightled.
0,@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
0,@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
0,@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
0,@united i sure will
0,"@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?"
0,"@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s."
0,@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
0,@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
0,@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
0,@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21.
0,@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
1,@united social media team is on point on #OscarNight :)
0,@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence
0,@united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn't carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can't watch the Oscars. #united
0,@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
0,"@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay."
0,@united I need help with a missing bag.
0,@united I was. But I have given up.
0,@united you changed my entire flight plan for vacation and now I will be there alone a day and night early with nowhere to stay. Help!
0,@united UA647 heading back to gate bc improper load? if ur packing us to the gills should at least take care to load bags. expecting comp...
0,@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
0,@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
0,@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
0,@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
0,@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
0,@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
0,@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
0,@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
0,@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
0,@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
1,@united thank you for following up!
1,@United Claudia in IAH terminal b travel assistance has me all set. Great service. Thank you.
0,"@united why doesn't my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?"
0,@united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit
0,@United and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse!
0,@united UA1565 IAH -&gt; SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy!
0,@united I don't know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I'm unable to do bc the site won't let me.Seems to be ongoing
0,@united How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed!
0,@united CDG-LAS 42 hours. And my luggage is in SFO. I've been wearing the same clothes for 42 hours. Thank you. #flythefriendlyskies
0,@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
0,@united why do you hate your passengers?
0,@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
0,.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
0,@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
0,@united what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!!  Fingers crossed!!!  #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw.
0,@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool!
0,@united they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location
0,@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
0,"@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me."
0,"@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines"
1,@united Denver baggage handlers you totally impressed us today. Our lungs barely made the run to connect but our bags had no problem! #DEN
0,"@united flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!!"
0,@united false.
0,"@united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all."
1,"@united thanks, it was my first time in a United lounge and felt welcomed."
0,".@united all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim"
0,@united Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at @flyLAXairport. Great job idiots.

1,@united I trust you enough to put my coat in my checked bag!
0,@united yes I have &amp; they're unsure when it would come.This has never happened on any airline and my first time with @united #disappointed
0,@united of course. But interesting how United doesn't seem to have a good sense on what's happening with flight
0,@united pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately.
1,"@united finally made it to rep, who solved my problem."
0,@united you guys are complete ass
1,@united thanks gate agent extraordinaire Seau Fong for helping me get re-booked out of Boise and (hopefully) home to NYC sometime tonight!
0,@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
1,@united Thank y'all for being an amazing airline who knows how to treat their customers. you guys rock!
0,@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
0,@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
1,@united went to Customer Service kiosk and they were able to help out! Still thanks for following up!
0,@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?
0,"@united your b737-800w  literally the smallest seats I have ever have, my dad got stuck In the tiny bathroom ad well #disspointed #premier1k"

0,"@united my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this morning because of a ""snow storm in Denver"". And now I'm in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+"
0,@united still sucks. I don't understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston international b gate #unitedsucks
0,"@united the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous ""I dunno what time you will leave today. "". Dunno?! That's code for ...?"
1,"@united on 2/20 Denver AP, gate B91 (destination Santa Fe), agent Ashley did an amazing job in the face of an angry traveler. Kudos."
0,@united has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter
0,@united I'd rather spend two days in the back seat of a Volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster
0,@united my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it's departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!!
0,@united I suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. Not my problem if someone complains!
0,"@united you could give me free flights for life, and I'd still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor."
0,@united The first time I flew United was horrible thought I would give you a second chance. There will NOT be a third! #disgruntled
0,@united flight from san fransico to jfk was evacuated why?
0,"@united 4994 out of Jackson, Wyoming... Delayed by no pilots.. Full toilets.. Deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. Cancelled Flightled flight pending"
0,@united is by far THE WORST airline I've ever had the misfortune of flying with in all the 44 countries I've flown to!!! It's outrageous!
0,"@united ... I want my bag off flight 1142, what do I do now?"
0,@united thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime
0,@united I hope you lose the next govt contract
0,@united lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux
0,@united i will just send my confirmation number when I get home safe and sound. This is why i pay so expensive services to you!
0,@united the bag is in a state that I didn't travel to and the airports don't fly to each other. Looks like it'll never show
0,@united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
0,@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
0,@united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing
0,@united seriously. This is just complete bs.
0,"@united, we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?"
0,@united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad!
0,@united Lied to my face at the gate about upgrades. Thanks. #badservice #unitedsucks
0,@united I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake
0,@united ouch not fair
0,@united is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don't know how to value the customer
0,@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
0,@united if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
0,@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
0,"@united flight delayed...again...every time. ""Maintenance issues"""
1,@united I should be fine. They automatically changed my connecting flight for me so I wouldn't miss it. A+ work.
0,@united yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned
0,@united and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice
0,@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
0,"@united heard about the voucher/miles credit for Cancelled Flighting my international flight yesterday, but I didn't get an email."

1,"@united thx off the response, finally got through the 45 min wait and talked to someone."
0,@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
0,@united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again
0,@united - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents @yyz said their too busy. Not cool http://t.co/6KpyhckA9l
0,@united @rayja9 flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made
0,@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation
0,"@United - In case you're reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules."
0,"@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space."
1,"@united Thx, just DM'd. Conf #'s MQXC64 &amp; MPWNC2. Any help appreciated"
0,"@united Delayed 7 hrs flight 5721 PIT/IAD, finally board the plane, sit half hour &amp; crew is at their hrs limit &amp; we deplane. Unacceptable."
0,@united stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K....
0,@United Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I'm glad it's free for now.
0,@united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It's been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame..
0,"@united agent, ""You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full."" Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited"
0,"@united should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks."
0,@united united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation &amp; no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.

0,"@united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update."
0,@United 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out?
0,@united I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge.
0,@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
0,"@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me"
0,@United is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time.

0,"@united - well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!!"
0,@united I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on.  Now I'm going to LAX instead of Hawaii.  :(
0,@united reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn't reseated. This only happens on international itineraries
0,@united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don't have time.
0,"@united 

There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations."
0,"@united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service."

0,"@united - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time??"
0,@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
0,"@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this?"
0,"@united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really?"
0,@United rescheduled my return flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
0,@united is by far the worst airline ever üò°üò°
0,"@united, no. Re-booked with American and United said they'd transfer our bags to them."
0,@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
0,@united I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed
0,@united Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess
0,@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
0,"@United no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch"
0,Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry @united ?  I hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #BadCustomerService
0,@united Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that's 7 hours you had. #fail!
0,@united so many delays today...What's up with that? Hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #United #premier1K

0,@united called back and I've been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I've paid
0,"@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?"

0,@united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app

0,@united so what's the solution?
0,@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
0,@united no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
0,@united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper
1,"@united we got it, thanks."
0,@united The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do..
1,"@united This is probably the least dependable airline in the Western Hemisphere. @united does not belong in Star Alliance, but SkyTeam"

0,"@united broken light, 35 mins to get bridge to gate, airplane parked wrong , bathroom not emptied last night....your airline in last 3 hrs"

0,@united who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don't even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH http://t.co/T78k7aBtWF
0,@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?
0,@united oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system.
0,@united feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL
0,@united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable
0,@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?
0,@united employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
0,@united you can't say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn't even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi
0,@united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand
0,@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
0,@united you guys are horrible! First we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate
0,"@united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting"

0,@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
0,@united this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance.
0,@united you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes! Each flight has a maintenance issue!!!
0,@united any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled
0,@united you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws
0,@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr
0,@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
0,@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!
0,@united Please follow FAA guidelines regarding bumping. It is NOT acceptable to give a $300 voucher for an $800 fare when you've

0,".@united Our newest delay, right now http://t.co/96fTLZWtvO"

0,@united 50 min on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out.  Agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability??? badbadbad
0,@united is a joke.  Lots of angry people at IAH this AM.
0,@united completely unacceptable to seat 1st class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy)
0,"@united Found flight after 2.5 hrs. How am I offered a $200 flight voucher 12 hrs before, lose my seat out of neglect, then get nothing?"
1,"@united Nicole at Quito airport took great care of us this week. Handled lost baggage, seat changes. Very professional/nice. Pat her back."
0,"@united right as we think we will take off, we stop to get de-iced. Why wasn't this done when the planes were sitting out all night?"
0,@united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight
0,@united Delayed more and more these days. MCO &gt; IAD. Fingers crossed I make my connection home to Albany. #united1K
0,"@united your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don't ask for extra peanuts... That's NOT allowed! @AirCanada"
0,@united I have been given a connection with 2 overnight layovers. No vouchers. Last connection not even confirmed.
1,@united thanks for leaving our 3 year old in his own row flight 360 LAX-IAD

0,@united thank you for fully boarding flight 1689 this morning before noticing we had no pilots. #fail

0,@united lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever!
0,@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
0,@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
0,@united why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
0,@united fuck you for not caring üò¢
0,"@united its been five days, I'm just asking you to clarify your policy on car seats. I don't want to have to take this higher up."

0,@united If United loses your baggage they will get it to the airport in the country your in and then it disappears!
0,"@united Thank you for wasting my time &amp; money. Not only will I now arrive 5 hours Late Flight to my destination, but..."
0,@United DO NOT FLY UNITED WITH CHECKED BAGGAGE! It will never find you!
0,@United why can't you have an English/Spanish rep call me so we can locate my bag and resolve this issue?
0,@united why would you overnight my bag Wed to an unknown location with a courier company you apparently can't contact!
0,"@united Hey, thanks again for helping me miss my buddies 30th bday, you guys are really a trashy company #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks"
0,@united I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can't speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag!
0,@united I have never been mislead by a company as many times as I have this week by United Airlines!
0,@united I would never fly United Airlines again!
0,@united I am still in the airport waiting for my flight.
0,@united your airline has been telling me that my luggage is one hour away from my destination for 5 days!
0,@united now there is no one to operate the ramp to let us out of the plane in IAH...wow..just wow

0,@united is your check-in system down? I'm having trouble checking in for a flight that departs in less than 24 hrs.
0,"@united, fuck you and your closed premier access lines at ORD. Probably gonna miss my flight...Start treating your customers better."

0,@united no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from @AmericanAir cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to?
0,@united you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with @Delta
0,"@united I would understand if weather was the issue, but bc of airline maintenance I had to sleep on an airport floor and lose an entire day"

0,"@united help me, united! I paid for economy plus on a flight that was changed BC of delay. Will I be automatically refunded?"
0,@united The engineer that designed the 787 door frame to extend half a foot into the plane for seat 27A should be forced to always sit here
0,"@united your service need work - check out this Bush airport ""customer service line"" last nt #unitedagainstunited http://t.co/g00sAozgtv"

0,@united it is too Late Flight for reFlight Booking Problems now - it is morning already and I no longer need a hotel room
0,@united  once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. Do you actually care about customers or just making money?
0,@united you have Cancelled Flightled my flight UA922 for aircrft maintenance. I'm delayed 10 hours now. What's my refund options?
0,@united where is my bag?? I'm in Mexico about to go build a house &amp; my suitcase never got on my flight from CLE w me. I need it. SAN68059M

0,@united This has been the WORST flight experience I've ever had. Thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note.
1,@united thanks for the epic service on 863- always a pleasure- outstanding crew http://t.co/trqlpeinzW
0,"@united hey, it's 4am, guess what I'm doing? Not sleeping! Why? Cause you care so little about your customers you let them sleep in airports"
0,@united no my concerns were not addressed
0,@united DUH and done. bag whereabouts unknown. Greeeaat
0,"@united thanks for letting me sleep at DIA to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. Wait, no, fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks"
0,"@united oh, I'll be sharing alright. Especially about sleeping in this shitty airport and getting 1hr of sleep all night because UA."
0,@united @MaxAbrahms *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff?
0,Thanks @united for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask?
0,@united you hung up on me again.
0,"@united your ""customer service"" team in manilla is absolute shit. I can't even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?!"
0,@united it's disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I've received tonight.
0,@united of course I would like hepl! Are you kidding me? That's the ONLY reason I've been on hold for the past 5 hours!
0,@united @ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
0,@united you've got to be kidding me. I still haven't talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow????
0,".@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it."
0,@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
0,"@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,"
0,@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
0,@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
0,@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
0,@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
0,@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
0,@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
0,@united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
0,@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
0,@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
0,@united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550
0,@united - you sure missed the mark on tonight's redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better!
0,@united after 443min of avoidable non-weather delays that #Appreciation link better be giving out #GoldenTickets

1,@united Life goal: complete ‚úîÔ∏è
0,@united flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me.
0,"@united That's called throwing ""loyalty"" out the window and trying to give less awards."
0,"@united your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I'm in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??"
0,"@united I'd hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk?"
0,@united that's not an apology. Say it.
1,@united Just sent a DM. Thank you for the acknowledgment.
0,@united been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning. What do you suggest?
0,@united no apology? Cool.
0,"@united you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right?"
0,@united I'm a first time solo female traveller and it's pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
0,"@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers...."
0,@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
0,@united Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100's of people. HNL -&gt; IAH (UA252) #wastedtime
0,@united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.
0,@united we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time.
0,"@united poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage"
0,"@united has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how ""wifi is coming!"" Hah.Not before I leave. @VirginAmerica ftw"
0,"@united more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather http://t.co/Flcnnn2USD"
0,@united look at all the delta flights that landed while your pilots claimed they couldn't fly 6232 to JAC. http://t.co/6Kp4m0R1f7
1,@united thank you! Much appreciation for your help.
0,"@united Been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in Newark. First no gate, then no jetway operator. Seriously!?"
0,@united worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354   Disappointed
0,@united - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting  for over 1 hr
0,@united look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight http://t.co/o1u96Xc3bo
0,"@United - routing a person from Houston to Newark, NJ  and then to SFO is not acceptable."

0,@united it would be great to get a callback from the agent that disconnected me trying to put me on hold after waiting to connectfor 60+min
0,"@united not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent."
0,"@united my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this?"
0,@united I'm extremely disappointed w my service for this trip as a #United #MileagePlus Explorer Card holder.
0,@united I hope your corporate office is ready to deal with the rage created by your shitty service and bullshit pilots. #UnitedAirlinesSucks
1,@united such a relaxing space for a drink before my flight! (at @United Global First Lounge) https://t.co/j4cj0lrF2d http://t.co/dTLGUQ1kAk
0,@united i will never fly with you again. i went on vacation this week and you lost my bags both ways. now i have no clothes. thankyou

0,@united do you expect to Cancelled Flight flights out of @DENAirport tomorrow morning given the storm?
0,@United also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk
0,@United Can you increase the legroom? : How airlines compare http://t.co/diUfep8n2q via @CNNMoney
0,"@united on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?"
0,@united 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It's been one mess up after another. Bad day @united
0,@united the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and I see 2 right there. #unitedlies
0,@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
0,"@united sitting in Denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. For an hour and a half! Hurry the fuck up United, you fucking retards"
0,@united I'm rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though I had 1st class seat orig I have a lousy coach seat
0,@united well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter
0,@united who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you don't have enough flight attendants?? http://t.co/96apr35qan
0,@united we've been seating for 5hrs inside flight UA936 at #IAD delayed. We've only been offered water &amp; cookies in business class. #failed
0,@united please get me off this plane #UA57
0,@united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable.
0,@united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!?
0,"@united your app says flight UA936 to #ZRH departed 2:45hrs Late Flight, but 5 hours Late Flightr we are still seating inside the plane in #IAD.  #failed"
0,@united not completely.  Our flight was changed in July but we never received notification.
0,@united Wife and I have two new destinations and I'm stuck in DC until Monday with no bags
0,@united no I don't. Spoke with baggage contact at 1-800 number. Said they will try to get bags to stay at IAD for pick up tmrw
0,@united can you make sure I‚Äôm on the upgrade list for 2/23 EWR-PDX using my GPU priority? Got a weird email about it.
1,@united so is that two seats avail so far for us.
0,@united has once again earned a place as the worst airline in the business
0,"@united when I read it say ' in some cases' can you please define this for me, when for example would it not be the case?"
0,@united I'm trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn't a hard stream.
0,"@united Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff"
0,"@united flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight"
0,@united why don't you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for
0,"@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much"
0,@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
0,@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
0,"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm."
0,@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
0,@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
0,@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
0,@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.
0,@united Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn't care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs
0,@united My contact stuff is in the bag and I'm legally blind. This is so messed up.
0,@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.
0,@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!
0,@united Tell me that you're at least going to cover a room and get me out of here.
0,@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
0,@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
0,"@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr""."
0,@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
0,@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa
0,"@United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?!"
0,@united why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick
0,.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
0,@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
0,@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help
0,@united what a nightmare!!  Both sides of my flights are a disaster!  At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter
0,@united you're terrible.
0,@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
0,@united Anyone there? Did you read my DM?
1,@united 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!!
0,"@united EWR TO MCO made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. Worst pain I've EVER felt, I thought I was going to pass out"
0,@united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
0,@united it's been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @FoxNews @CNN @msnbc
0,@united trying to get a customer service agent.  Just landed in SFO.  Can't fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!!
0,@united nope I gave up - maybe they'll deliver it
1,@united Thanks for the upgrade- please try to get my company to approve more business class travel.
0,@united more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications!
0,@united and waiting
0,@united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow!  Have a ship to board!  The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts.
1,@united Hubby made it by the skin of his teeth!   :)
0,@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
0,"@united 1st u delay my flight for mechanical failure,then 2 hrs on the runway, &amp; 13 hrs Late Flightr I'm still here with a lost bag &amp; no resolution"

0,"@united #customerservice at @Dulles_Airport could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful."
0,"@united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays."
0,"@united Additionally, my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight."
0,"@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would"
0,@united your baggage person told me to go through @AirCanada - they're handling my connecting flight.
0,@united I sent a PM over two weeks ago and have heard nothing!  #horribleservice #unitedsucks
0,"@united Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I'm Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for @Delta"

0,.@united Let us know when you find everyone's luggage. Thanks. #UnitedAirlines
0,@united Nope! I'm on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice.
0,"@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm."
0,@united just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies
0,@united 6 minutes to boarding at b12 in Ord. No sign of gate agent. A little help?
0,@united website says my flight is on time. It leaves in 15 min and nobody has boarded yet. #pathetic #needtobehonest
0,@united From the air: Another missed cnxn 2day. ATC went on strike in Belize this AM. Now family &amp; I miss cnxn in EWR. Please see my DMs.
0,@united we are the airline that has Cancelled Flightled flights TOMORROW to the NYC area
0,@united having to pay for a hotel room in Cleveland because of last minute Cancelled Flightled connecting flight. Booked through united..Unimpressed!
0,@united I was on UA3782 and it was Cancelled Flightled. I'm waiting at customer service.
0,@united Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it!
0,@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks
0,@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
0,"@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!"
0,@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
0,Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
0,@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.
0,@united I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I'd have to pay.
0,@united never again.
1,@united tonight you made this Fred Flintstone happy with an upgrade to 1st class. http://t.co/gKgKZLAwpR
0,@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
0,@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest
0,@united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.
1,@united that's great! pls let me know when u start!
0,"@united God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit."
0,@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
0,@united sucks.
0,@united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?
0,@united is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,@united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.

0,@united quality work going on here. http://t.co/9xbO5daKaK
0,@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed
0,@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.
0,"@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent."
0,@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
1,@united I see. Thanks for explaining.
0,@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
0,@united If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call.
1,"@united After an hour+ wait, my issue is resolved. I did contact customer service to comment on the wait time. Thanks for contacting me."

0,@united A friend traveled via UA1470 today and never got their luggage. What recourse does the person have? Buy clothes and get reimbursed?
0,@united I keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on http://t.co/p3N2w8JfpS. Have tried at least 4x.

0,@united we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! It is ridiculous!!
0,"@united, no, your service here pretty much ruined my day, but thanks for the weak attempt"
0,"@united what, you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... Thanks for allowing me to miss my connection"
0,"@united Such as deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste. Seems like that would be limited to 70oz, correct?"
0,@united Why was I forced to check my rollaboard on UA 715? Plenty of room in the overhead next to my seat. http://t.co/5xvNnmLTiW
0,@united please don't take my membership away :(
0,"@united. Please get me an economy plus seat. Awful day of 2 Cancelled Flighted flights, after lots of planning."

0,@united my husband is supposed to fly RDU to IAD then IAD to FRA leaving in 2 hours. You Cancelled Flighted his flight and there's a 1hr wait on phone
0,@united is probably the least satisfactory airline I've ever been on. Never fails to disappoint.
1,@united this flight has been amazing. This is the best flight I have ever been on I am not kidding. Service is INCREDIBLE!
0,@united not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don't care
0,@united who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in #Belize right now.
0,@united I fly @AmericanAir normally.  This doesn't happen to me with them.  I'll let your flyers provide their own feedback. Thank you.
1,@united the upgrade to first class was a nice way to fix your earlier mistake. Thank you!
0,@united how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don't sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail
1,@united Rhonda C. at Atlanta airport redeemed you guys. She got us straightened out.
0,"@united ok so what is being done about my experience? My family had a terrible experience for $1,200. It's kind of like being robbed.Explain"

0,@united have an employee at the gate 15min before boarding like u expect ur customers to. Be a competent company like ur rivals
0,@united No wonder the cabin is filthy. #badservice
0,"@united And then when we asked the stewardess to take the disinfectant wipe as trash she said, ""not with my hands!"" #badservice"
0,@united I need #United to be a better airline!!
0,@united flight was Cancelled Flightled due to mechanical issues but when I ask for cab fare they say it was weather and can't help me
1,"@united Hi there, looks like my connection is delayed too so I'll make it. Thanks!"
0,"@united Luckily, I had my disinfectant wipes and did your job for you. You're welcome. #badservice"
0,@united You really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard. Gross!
1,@united cldnt be happier w the many plastic wing pins given to me on flight 494. I love them! Amazing staff! So nice http://t.co/CbV7f3KBKx
0,@united help? Invest more in your planes and your people and less in stock buybacks and executive pay. Maybe then you would not disappoint.

0,@united that's a crazy long form! You need something other than a video?
0,@united I hope not to see the same issue on my return flight tomorrow

0,@united You shouldn't page o'head that it's best to call 1-800# - on hold 26+ mins
1,@united thanks for the reply.  If you can get me a better seat on my next leg to Munich. That would be nice.
0,@united appreciate getting put on hold for 20min and then getting hung up on because I was requesting help for big group. I'll try #Delta
0,@united thank you for your reply.  My frustration is that spending a upgrade just puts you on a wait  list.
0,@united @nathankillam or your staff could try not throwing the luggage around.
0,@united 4 of us are stranded   And flying from New Orleans to Huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days. Rather fly than wait.
0,@united hello I am flying first class and am behind 20 people on zone 1!!!!!  Pls pass on to app dept - you should board 1st class first
1,@united thank you for taking care of my mom and reFlight Booking Problems her flight in phl.
0,"@united can't get anyone to deal with me in person. Cowardly customer service, I can't be looked in the eyes by anyone."
0,"@united nope. Called, lost the seating preference I paid for, and here I still sit. We'll see what happens w/ my flight Late Flightr."

0,"@united I was insulted, disrespected and met with incompetence at every turn how about a voucher for a domestic round trip"
0,@united. DAY to IAD and CVG to IAD both Cancelled Flightled by United but all other airlines operating. Friend stuck and now miss intl flight. Help?

1,@united They finally gave in a let him on. After they threatened to send him back to Vegas on coach. Thnx.

0,@united can anyone assure me that the aircraft coming to Denver had left it's previous destination? Flight 3618
0,@united yes refund my ticket and give me email address to let u know what happened

0,"@united we are delayed in San Pedro, Belize. We are scheduled to fly out at 3pm from Belize City to Houston. Will you wait please?"
0,@united Hello United. You should take care of your call center in Mexico City Office. Terrible attitude from the lady who was helping me.
0,"@united Great!  I'm guessing you were Late Flight to open, service is horrible, you're overcharging, and don't care that everyone is miserable."
0,@united UNBELIEVABLY DISAPPOINTED. DELAY AFTER DELAY. STOP MESSING WITH MY LIFE.

0,@united I'm not sure why I expected anyone to be here http://t.co/bnFlHPXtmw

0,@united Hate when I get bumped out of the seat I've selected (&amp; empty row) and moved to another seat (non-empty). #1K #flt803 #nonupgrade!
0,"@united no announcement re extra baggage, ""find an empty bin"" down to aisle 20 back up with baggage to my seat row 7. YOUR agents argueing"

0,.@united too much info to share via tweet. Please send me your name and contact info. Happy to supply you with images and CS rep names.
0,@united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff!
0,@united Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane
0,"@united besides landing the plane, overall customer service experience has been poor. Late Flight and rude workers plus missing luggage"
0,"fuck you, @united and your shitty fucking information http://t.co/scQUjbvsTA"
1,@united you're good. Thank you!
1,"@united Wasn't frustrating! Well, not in any way reLate Flightd to y'all, anyway. Impressed that I made it."

0,"@united customer service: 16hr delay coupon can only be redeemed on website which has $200 higher prices than Expedia, call wait time 55mins"
0,@united I'm strongly considering taking my business elsewhere. #UnitedAirlines
0,"@united your website won't allow me to post the required document, i keep getting **were having technical difficulties**"
0,"@united really needs to start upgrading their planes. No TVs &amp; then the ""inflight wifi"" is currently unavailable #UnitedAirlines"
0,@united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
0,@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first
0,@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
0,@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
0,@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days.
0,@united what incentive do I have to give you another chance?
0,@united Finally I get the right response. United must check this issue. UA 1514 EWR to PUJ on Friday 02/20/15.

0,@United site errored out at last step of changing award. Now can't even pull up reservation. 60 minute wait time.  Thanks @United!
0,@united you get a 2nd chance today as I fly to A'dam. Let's see if you can redeem yourself after that last horrendous trip to the states.
1,@united Very impressed so far. An app that's worth a damn and sms updates on my flight.
0,@united just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines
0,@united airlines 1st &amp; only time I ever fly your airline! What a disgrace. @JimTrotter_NFL I should've listened to your tweet! #HORRIBLE
0,"@united diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks."
0,@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
0,@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
0,@united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.
0,@united terrible service for military members and their families. #ridiculous #UnitedAirlines
0,@united My flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm needing some help reFlight Booking Problems.
0,"@united I was, just very surprised it took over 15 mins. Never experienced anything like that on 1K number"
0,@united I'm afraid not... I fly or service every week and I'm just unhappy..spend too much money to be unhappy
1,"@united thank you.
It's my daughters 13th bd party w/proj. weather cond, it doesn't look promising.
Please assist with earlier flts to Cmh?"
0,"@united if you're going to Cancelled Flight flights today, do everyone a favor and get on it now. Don't stall the inevitable."
0,@united your plane's been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck.
0,"@united 
Flight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience"
0,@united his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better.
0,@united 15.99 for wireless?  Was 6.99 epic #fail . #greedy #piggy you are the worst!
0,@united have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? What will the FAA &amp; NYT say ? http://t.co/bNgpli8JT6
0,"@united your ""Airserv"" contractors aren't worth a wet damn. 30min Late Flight, still not done w bags on UA1566. They made checkin a calamity."
0,@united Will never fly with you again! Terrible service!! Ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement
0,"@united web app won't let me upgrade seats, call center wait time is 20 minutes plus, just want to get more legroom but it's a pita"
0,@united 132 characters does not cover my reasons I'm afraid
0,@united while busy on his cell phone ???
0,"@united really, fill out a form about my flight experience? I sent an email to the 1K email address."
0,"@united: ""Left gate 5 minutes early."" 
My thoughts: ""That doesn't count if you sit on the Tarmac for a half hour."" #comeonpeople"
1,@united will the kudos to capt. Herman be relayed to his chief pilot or should I be emailing someone?
0,@united on flight 1665 but it's not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?
0,"@united do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just learn on their own? There was overhead space for my bag,  didn't have to check"
0,@united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me.  How do i get it
0,@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
0,"@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best"
0,"@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM"
0,@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual
0,@united I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320. Ugh.
1,@united good job at CLE .. TPA on schedule ... 4 to 5 inches of snow ! http://t.co/9tbsJquw41

0,"@united my flight out of BGM Cancelled Flightled last night, I get a hotel voucher, but had to pay for a cab back. Worse cab experience ever"
0,"@united's first flight (4651, to #IAH) from #IAD is delayed...because no one hooked up ground power to the plane. Get it together, folks."
0,"@united  UA 1706 there is no way a plane ""loses its software"" I believe you decided to do an upgrade..."
0,@united already missed connection... UA 495
0,@united typically once you get the problem fixed - then the crew expires - and the delay turns into a Cancelled Flight...
0,"@united UA 1706 delayed again - I get charged $600 if Late Flight by you - you say ""oh well"""
0,"@united Friend stuck in bus on runway at PEK with two small kids no customer service, no explanation, kids crying, awful service."

0,@united so much for being here to help. Very disappointed in your customer service.
0,@united your system is down and after being on hold for over 20 mins -Mia tells me she is going to charge a Flight Booking Problems fee?! Customer service?
0,@united She üëè won't üëè be üëè at üëè my üëè wedding üëè. This is an irreplaceable milestone. There's no reFlight Booking Problems. How can we be repaid for this?

0,"@united very exasperating I'm having a difficult time with Flight Booking Problems as the error message says you're undergoing maintenance. Really, now?"
1,.@united This flight attendant was extremely helpful to a woman who had a hard time walking. Very touching!
0,@united lax29108m make it happen please else on a cruise with no luggage tomorrow
0,@united no I did not make connection.  Your stellar employee Vicky Thomas refused to board me even though 23 empty seats on plane
0,@united Of course. That was the start of my trip 3 wks. ago. Its gone further downhill on my return.
0,@united no u don't
0,"@united how much longer will it take? It a guitar, not a royal commission!"
0,"@united sure, but 8 different texts changing time &amp; gate (especially locations across the entire concourse). That just seemed a little off."

1,@united awesome thank you very much for the help
0,"@united @airlines. Agents arguing about check bag announcement. Looked for room until seat 20, gave up and walked back to seat 7.Unnecessary"
0,"@united you should change your name to United Incompetence. No flight until Monday, have to take a 7 hour drive now to get to my flight!"
0,"@united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I'd be mortified if my employees acted as yours"
1,@united kept me watching the safety video for the first time in forever. Nice job üëç.

0,@united I sent a DM re an existing reservation but no one has responded
0,@united I miss the Continental days.
0,@united or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares.
0,"@united It wasn't full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?!"
0,@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!
0,"@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?"
0,"@united first you lost all my bags, now you Cancelled Flight my flight home. 30 min wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough"
1,"@united Great landing in Denver, next Rapid City. Snow starting to fall...Florida Everglades is a faint sunburn away...here comes the cold!"
1,@united Looking forward to flying with you guys as well !!

0,@united is UA938 still taking off at 9:05pm? I'm stuck on the tarmac on UA3462 waiting to get in.
0,@united you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.
0,@united - we're sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can't find captain. #ridiculous #united
0,@united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced...
1,@united. You guys made my day. Treated me well. Thank you!!!
0,@united Stuck in Houston because you can't seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions.
0,@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.
0,@united how much longer United?? Been on the phone for over an hour to straighten out a star alliance upgrade!!! http://t.co/U1ViEuiDF5
1,"@united Don't know her last name, but Karen at your call center is terrific.  Friendly, helpful.  Terrific representative. Kudos."
0,@united I'm Cancelled Flighting my #mileageplus card and I will NEVER do business with you again. You clearly don't care about your customers.
1,"@united thank you! Good service, safe flight... 1/2 way home!"
0,"Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you ""can't do anything"" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7"
0,@united Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility.  You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw
0,@united you guys suck!
0,"@united never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot."
0,@united second time flying into Houston and 45+ mins waiting for luggage at baggage. Typical? Still waiting..

0,"@united again HORRIBLE service, again attitude when asked for information, again you make me not want to fly UNITED ever. #platinummember"
0,@united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.
0,@united thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport http://t.co/IG2dgctt2M
0,@united go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great.
0,"@united Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn't fix it. Flight was listed on website, but ""unavailable""to book. False advertising much?"
1,"@united I may not hit any new status this year, but I‚Äôve flown several times this year and have tried to book with y‚Äôall every time!"
0,"@united unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes ""like every 15 minutes."" Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we're taking a cab. You going to reimburse?"
0,"@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?"
0,@united Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none.
0,"@united not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks"
0,@united thank you for the reply. I emailed your customer care department about my experience.
0,@united How can I file a claim when your agents won't let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON'T find my bag
0,@united I had one interview I was the last person what does that mean?
0,@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united
1,@united I just received notification of in-flight Wi-Fi for UA863 from @flySFO to @SydneyAirport. Amazing!
0,@united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this.
1,@united give her the recognition she deserves!
1,@united she's the type of person that can make a customers day! I fly 100+ times a year &amp; she's one of the top flight attendants I've had!
0,@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.
0,@united been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end?
1,@united you suck. @SouthwestAir you're the best.
0,@United can you let us out of the gate now. UA1157
0,"@united &amp; on top of no free tv on the int‚Äôl leg, now I‚Äôm sitting on the Tarmac in Houston, 70 min past departure w/ another hr plus to go"
0,"@united DTV doesnt work, pilots Late Flight, wont let 10yr old fly next 2 me and I paid 4 an upgrade. #unitedsucks"
0,"@united Your ""Loyalty Team"" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google ""loyalty"" and get back to me? ^LOL"
0,"Hey @united, this is your job, don't give me the safety spin. This is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedSucks"
1,@united Thank You
0,"@united, if you mean beyond opaque ""maintenance issues"", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage."
0,"@united ""Dear Ted. We don't care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United"""
0,. @united sad that you don't think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful
0,@united Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1)
0,@united - #epicfail from a former gate agent in PIA!  He walked away and quit! Luckily a responsible PIA agent saved the day!
0,@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.
0,@united will do. Thx. Been sitting on plane now for 2.5 hrs and now we have to refuel!  I can't even make this stuff up.
0,@united do you know how to use twitter bro?  Your terminal looks like it's in Bosnia.  Here's another pic. http://t.co/M9Nywr5Kbs
0,@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
0,@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.
0,@united now I'll probably miss my next connection!
0,@united you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.
0,"@united not the case. Now delayed due to ""mechanical issues with no update on departure time"". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta"
0,@united 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues?  Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!!
0,@united I didn't get a message from you. I'll resend numbers.
0,@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp; resting elbows don't mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume.
0,@united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.
0,"@united Listen, learn &amp; do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA"
1,@united thank you for the reply.  I will fill out the form and submit it as requested.  Good to know you're paying attention!
1,@united Gate Agent Alavera is amazing
0,@united I need you...to be a better airline. ^LOL
0,@united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business!
1,@united wins top marks for customer service via Twitter. They turned a poor experience into a positive. Many thanks for the effort! üëç
0,@united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!

0,"@united is really getting horrible. So much for tucking in my kids tonight. Delta transfers miles/status, right? http://t.co/H6HN33JJJE"
0,@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
0,@united roundtrip to London on @Delta ? I think I will! FYI that's another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies

0,"@united Also, group 5 is total BS."
0,@united Don't ask me to be patient without offering something in return.
0,"@united just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100"
0,@united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable
1,@united free booze for the Bach party would make it better!  ORD--&gt;MSY #Delayed #Again   We will enjoy either way.  Thanks!
0,"@united incompetent/rude service today. Missed my connecting flight, then the customer service desk was terrible to me. Really upset w untd."
0,@united - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for return but can't change.
0,@united 5.5 hours Late Flightr I've been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO
1,@united all good man it isn't your fault that plane is having maintenance issues

0,"@united I know. I‚Äôm sure you hear it all the time ‚Äî don‚Äôt like the new seats. I‚Äôm a small guy, 5‚Äô 6‚Äù and I feel the new planes are tight"
0,@united how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs
1,@united When are you coming back to @IFlyOAKland? You have a huge East Bay customer base due to SFO and *I* miss you!
0,@united also doesn't help me. I'm a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing.
0,@united delayed another hour
0,@united Can't beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight.  NWS issued storm warning already...
0,@United @Skywest do it again!   I will now miss one or probably both our Aspen events. #Fail
0,"@united don't need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable."
0,"@united add wifi, entertainment and the old seats and i‚Äôll come back."

0,@united 4016 529557.   You going to transfer my car to me too?  Because it's at the airport you couldn't get me too...
0,"@united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can't deliver it in a timely manner."
0,"@united I'm sorry it's cold in chicago, but I don't see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel."
0,@united you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool.
0,@united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight
1,@united Thank you. Any help is appreciated.
0,@united I know where to check. My complaint is my ticket said dinner when I booked now it's changed to refreshments. Where's my refund?
0,@united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated
0,@united we can't all be american airlines I suppose... http://t.co/0EWj7oKlji

0,@United you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights Cancelled Flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost!  You NEVER get it right.
0,".@united It's worth saying that, if you litter in Singapore, you get caned. ""But there are rules"" says @united"
0,"@united I'm fully aware, it's just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you're going to resell my seat for more $."
0,@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH
0,@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
0,@united this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
0,"@united not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated."
1,‚Äú@united: @d_goodspeed We will follow up with our Maintenance team. Thanks for the tweet. ^KP‚Äù THANK YOU!  United Cares!
0,@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.
0,@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
0,"@united its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark"
0,@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
0,"@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly."
0,@United I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you.

0,@united I can't even look at you right now. I'll call you when I'm not so mad.
0,"@united I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach"
0,"@united Nope, still sitting at the gate!"
0,@united the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and returned back in o gate that should not count as a valid journey
0,"@united yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the return flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations"
1,@united thank you.. Appreciate the response
0,.@united I appreciate you looking. Can you compensate me on anything for my troubles? Still haven't taken off for a 10:30 am flight
1,@united thank you thank you thank you for contacting me. Thank you for the offer of a $1000 travel certificate #unitedairlines
0,@united Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed
0,"@united If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky"
1,@united sent a DM just now. Thanks I am incredibly happy the fast response I got via Twitter than via customer care. Thank you
0,@united please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane.

0,@united UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate.
1,@united thanks

0,"@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't."
0,@united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/QdXfT9qqT9
0,@united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness?
0,@united @JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes
0,@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
1,@united On the plane but thanks! Maybe don't let so many people check in by themselves - teeming with morons.
0,@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
0,"@united @bobwesson fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that ""slight delay"" is turning into a Cancelled Flightlation."
0,@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
0,@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.
0,@united why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line?
1,@united Looks like they came through. Thanks again for the help.
0,@united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie
0,@united hey! DM not working. UA 307!
0,@united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it's like sir u r lying how can I help
0,@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
0,@united contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used?
0,@united after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder
0,@united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather
1,@united since when did you get so good again!  4 transcontinental flights in 72h.  What a pleasure/relief you were.
0,@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
0,"@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous"
0,@united actually we aren't. Still parked here.
1,@united Thanks!
1,@united thanks for prompt response.  Another hour to enjoy vacation! Perhaps a bug in the app as it still shows 2:55.
0,@united Why can I only apply one travel certificate per itinerary even when I have multiple flights?
1,@united appreciate the sentiment and you were able to get me off the ground;still missed connection
0,"@united I log in, view reservations, try view specific reservation &amp; takes me back to login page,"
1,Thank you @united for your prompt assistance.
0,@united 3 times my flight has been delayed and I miss my next flight. This time you've lost my baggage. No clean clothes. $337 flight. Thx!

1,@united thanks for more timely updates.
0,@united I'm familiar with the procedure. It wouldn't be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler
0,@united I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn't seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact
0,@united cleaning a regional jet takes an hour?
1,@united Baggage check in and in flight crew the friendliest ever Flight#417 ogg to Lax !!!
0,"@united You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF?"
1,@united Thank you for your offer! All sorted out :-)
0,@united Flight 395. Rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes
0,@united I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days
1,@united I think this is the best first class I have ever gotten!!  Denver to LAX and it's wonderful!!!
1,@united of course not. The inflight crew was great!
1,"@united well played, ^LO."
1,@united The pilot of UA475 just landed this plane like he was gently placing us into a pile of whipped cream. Smoothest landing ever.
0,@united your website is a complete joke when using safari!
0,@united the new seats on the Canadaair regional jets just plain suck.
0,@united airlines abuse your expensive video equipment and overcharge you for the privilege http://t.co/SdyLuKR7pt via @robthecameraman
0,@united that's the reply? Lol hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. üòí
0,@united Did somebody say flight upgrade?
0,@united how is it tripitPro has accurate delayed dept. times and 2hours Late Flightr I hear the same from you? Just curious
0,"@united I can tell you. Your airline has lost mine and my families business. 
This day and age message through Twitter travels fast."
0,@united trying to reach him for the number. At last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye!
0,@united this is very disappointing. This is about customer service.
0,"@united boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can't wait to give up my gold status for AA."
0,@united @44Stocker my wife Sarah stocker did also called but could not connect me to customer service
0,"@united Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff"
0,@united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.
0,@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
0,@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
0,@united obviously no one knows a darn thing around here.  What are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/Ph8QJzaPKx
0,@united I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time.
0,@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
0,@united DM sent.  This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous.
0,@united delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays.
1,@united a big thanks to ^MN and ^KN or patiently clarifying the United domestic world to me.
0,@united uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change?
0,@united I'm rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I'll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler
0,"@united United Club team is A+ &amp; got me a seat Late Flightr. Still, not sure why a last min UAL Cancelled Flightlation costs me $ yet overbooked folks get $?"
0,"@united will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board  after the ""broken lightbulb"""
0,@united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
1,"@united thank you so much, that helps a ton. Whoever is on this Twitter acct today deserves a handshake and a hot chocoLate Flight. #problemsolvers"
1,@united can't wait!!! 787!!! @tpallini http://t.co/oDlall5eDH
0,@united flight 5187 to be specific. The last two were probably 30 feet apart and within sight of each other
1,@united love being told you would issue a refund when you couldn't get us out of the way of a hurricane to have it denied
0,@united Without baggage for 5 days and can't get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever!
0,@united yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. Overkill
0,@united Bummer. Might have to go with @AmericanAir card instead. TY for response though.
0,@united or I'm sure her business will go else where for airline travel. Her name is Kathryn Sotelo
0,"@united made to check in my carry on from Flight 1449 PBI to Newark. Plane luggage stow not full. U r costing me time, money &amp; aggravation!"
0,@united I have no way to contact her while she is in flight. This does not work for me. Her father is about to pass and is heading to Denver
0,"@united we are on two more flights today, let's hope the kit does not get the same treatment!! http://t.co/Pd3nbAAkxH"
1,@united thnx!
0,@united - please help regarding PNR A3ZZ0F. Why am I now waitlisted for a flight?
0,@united I hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue
0,@united customer service has no solution and now we might miss a show because of them
0,@united deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we're going to miss
0,@united FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that's fixed but can't board because flight crew didn't stay in boarding area #fail
0,@united not anymore.  Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff.  Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket.
0,"@united yes, but they still don't know where it is.  I've been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it."
0,"@United wind chill in Ithica -17 degrees, and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t-shirt. I'll burn it for warmth. #united"
1,"@united Aw, thanks for the kind words. Totally makes these extra 6 hours sitting in an airport SOOOO much better."
0,"@united I will be calling customer service. 2 delayed flights today now, luggage misplaced, a disaster across the board."
0,"@united crew has been notified, passenger moved but water not fixed. Now on tarmac two hours"

1,"@united as u might imagine, this former pilot was particularly touched by the gesture. Please let the FO know #keepingtraditionsalive"
0,"@united Delayed CMH to ORD. Ran to gate 1 min b4 connection -door closed no one around. Ignored by 1st agent, 2nd super rude. #thanksunited"
0,"@united @upgrd I guess the Kit Kat looks tasty... not going near that ""sandwich."""
0,@united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket?
0,@united now 1558 from IAH to EWR has broken entertainment system and no WiFi despite info on app: http://t.co/FY6f9rZB9k
0,@united your customer service is terrible
0,@united please send help ASAP to @KathrynSotelo on flight 5957 to Chicago seat 9c #Airlines http://t.co/9sKrLyrZ1O
0,"@united define ""appreciate"". I doubt the worst major airline in the USA acts on much feedback."
0,"@united yea, a refund. Your airline ruined our trip."

0,@united that's wonderful. unfortunately doesn't help on this 4 hr flight between to major U.S. cities. #disappointed
0,"@united thanks for delaying our flight for an hour, missing our connecting flight and terrible customer service. #neveragain #vacation"
0,"@united Got rebooked on AA.  One question though, do you automatically refund the check baggage fees for flight that was Cancelled Flightled?"
0,@united It is all good -- your 1K team has been nothing short of amazing with everything.
0,@united new flight has me at the window. Kind of ticked off. I pick aisle seats only because I hate window seats. #annoyed #EpicFail
1,@united good fly!! #United #businessFirst
0,.@united Nope - had to rebook through Houston so I could get to Amarillo before 11pm. Stuck in SFO for four hours.
1,"@united thanks, i made it."
1,@united Thanks! Just DMed HN.
0,@united is a money sucking airline with terrible terrible customer service
0,@united - are you aware your airbus fleet sucks?  I'd rather fly a C-130 full of rubber dog shit.
0,@united https://t.co/jpd7NsGRT7. Fyi your staff are telling customers to try other carriers
0,@united couldn't have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed
0,@united no wifi on #ua688 #SF to #Chicago? 2015. That's all. Ps: This tech intro video is a joke. #EpicFail
0,@united Thanks for the reply. The box is not mine and I'm not missing one. It was added to my bag ....
0,@united no wifi on flight ua688. SF to ORD. Really?  Wow
0,@united is the worst http://t.co/27aitZl6nd
0,@united haha and you have to clean a plane that was held overnight in a hangar. Sounds lovely. Also don't lie on screensand say it's weather
0,@united no because you will charge me or delay me further. United 1612 still waiting.
0,@united I did and then she made me feel guilty because it was economy plus and I didn't pay for the extra leg room
0,@united my flight Cancelled Flightled new flight 5012 hopefully will not.
0,@united #4781 Cancelled Flightled. #5102newflight I will be upset if this one Cancelled Flights too. I could have rented a car if they would have been honest.
1,@united enjoyed #heathrow lounge so much i almost missed my @airnzusa flight!
1,"@united Hi, flight 1051. If I try and book a new one way,  flight departure shows up as 3:55pm which seems accurate."
0,@united Stuck in. ORD because United can't find their airplane. Lol. #upset terminal right now.
0,@united WTH be honest with your customers.  This better be the last change or we are driving home.  Has our plane left or not!
0,@united 2nd time in a row  I've been over charged by 100's of $$ on my plane ticket WHY? #united I shouldn't have to check my CC everytime
0,@united Is flight 5001 really going to leave Newark today?  If not tell us now and I will rent a car.  I do not want to end up stranded.
0,.@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it's not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG.
0,@united so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline
0,@united I'm sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don't cut it
0,@united or you'll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did
0,@united screwing me over twice in one month. Learned my lesson. We are through.
0,@united what's the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it?
1,@united Please send me the link/email to formally compliment Irene in SLC on some of the best customer service ever. #PaxEx
1,@united thnx ^LO :-)
0,"@united flight from vegas to houston Cancelled Flighted this morning ""due to operation"" what does this mean!???? Thank god I woke up early today!"
0,@united education of that staff is needed - he also turned away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus.
0,@united Item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #EWR to #YOW flight.  Missing a black box? http://t.co/SJQEmDtQmA
0,@united My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
0,"@united instead of making  seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint &amp; happy customers"
0,@united I need assistance with pulling your agents' heads out of their asses
0,"@united gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an ""UNMET ARRIVAL""!!"
0,@united @abigailedge Another glitch??
1,@united in spite of flight delay great customer service provided by Janet and baggage employee Karen. You have 2 wonderful employees United.
0,@united I really have a hard time believing that 4 planes in this terminal are all delayed for mechanical issues. #whatgives #dullessucks
0,"@United flight 4465 almost half an hour at the Tarmac ""waiting for papers""... Cannot miss my connection at IAH !"
0,@united worst airline ever. Thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse.
0,@united no chance in hell. I'd rather walk. Worst airline ever.
0,@United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?
1,@united always makes our cross country flights rad. @hemispheresmag here's baby flier Charlotte! #8thtime5MonthsOld http://t.co/kCqnwIXUCm
0,"@united Too Late Flight, damage has been done. Easily the worst airline experience of my life. Missed two connecting flights &amp; days of work. #UA49"
0,@united don't know if you are aware that ALL of your premier access lines are closed in your terminal. I feel the love.

0,@united disappointed to learn you are now charging $200 to use 20k miles for upgrades on PS JFK flights. Will be looking at alternatives.
0,@united @FAANews unacceptable practice to leave Cancelled Flighted flight passengers to sleep on cement with no pillows #UA1724 http://t.co/nDTLJ15ZpU
0,@united can u get the crew member that we are waiting on? We were told 40 minutes ago they landed here and they are still not to our gate.
0,@united Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal!
0,@united I had the worst customer experience at Houston intl airport... Your ground support even for @staralliance members is a nightmare
0,@united can you help me with a delayed flight as im going to miss my connection?
0,"@united I'm counting on you, please don't let me down! #delayed #again #needtocatchmynextflight #alreadyrebookedonce"
0,@United why is it so impossible to actually get a passenger AND their luggage to their final destination?

0,@united what is going on with baggage claim in Newark!#tiredandwanttogohome
0,@united usually your lounge staff are fantastic! Except today in MCO where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling united-first
0,"@united 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!!"
0,@united Why don't you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I'm still wating for my tickets!! I'm getting really angry and disappointed!
0,@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
0,@united So disappointed in the service and the level of staff communication. Such a bummer.
0,"Thanks @united, great news that u won't refund tickets due to a bad exchange rate. I knew u would come to your senses @gg8929 @UnitedAppeals"
1,@united  Thank you for a wonderful global first class flight on your 777 to FRA. Great service. (cont) http://t.co/46n9kDcsxU

1,"Thank you United! ‚Äú@united: @dan_roam That's a beautiful place to stay a day longer. Have you been re-booked? If not, let me know. ^MN‚Äù"
0,"@united to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep"
0,"@united it seems like no one from United can help me. Lots of fingers pointed, zero people stepping up. At least the gate has Oreos"
0,@united they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they?
0,"@united 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim  #inefficient"
0,@united has the worst flight attendants. They are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have. Everything has to be an argument.
0,@united its in black and white. EU law and all that ‚Ç¨600 for a Cancelled Flightled flight. I want my money
0,@united accordingly? U dont respond at all
0,"@united ""the extra care airline"". #unitedairlines they don't care. Trust me. There #customerservice is non existent. They don't have 1"
0,"@united Another unfortunate case of bad luck, usually maintenance issue. They are now swapping planes to ONT, will get in Late Flight. :("
0,@united it's a shame the great customer service wasn't continued in SFO. Slightly absurd

0,"@united still awaiting a reply from ur customer services?  18 days, no response? Lousy #unitedairlines"

0,@united has happened on other airlines and they've given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems.
0,"@united thanks, I'm booked. Just spent an extra 7 hrs in the TEN w/ no explanation. Now flying middle seat to CHAR instead of Memphis."

1,"@united i got it at the gate, thanks for checking!"
0,@united U kept passengers waiting all night 4 a plane that was being put out of service.  Leaving everyone stranded for night. #inexcusable
1,@united I especially like how you upgraded three of your crew members to first class instead of passengers. #keepitclassy #customerservice
0,@united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United!
0,@united I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of
0,Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP
0,@united @RobBogart After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can't UAL be honest with its customers?
0,"@united well. As of yet, our checked bag has already vanished and we haven't left the airport yet."
0,@united a rapid trip plane ticket from Idaho to California that doesn't have problems would be wonderful
0,@United agent did help me. My point: there's a problem &amp; I don't want it to mess up somebody else's plans. Can u flow this to tech team pls?
0,.@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I'm also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again

1,@united you guys are awesome! Thanks!
1,@united thnx
0,@united I think we both have the same status (nothing). I think there was a bug in your search system.
1,@united Anna Palm Springs gate 19  deserves a medal! Handled 30 ppl missing flights like a pro!
0,@united I would appreciate an answer on why we weren't alerted flight had been Cancelled Flighted until plane landed.  #showsomerespect

1,@united  Great customer service again. Thanks!
1,"@united thanks, that would be awesome."
0,"@united hey, left my computer bag, w/computer inside, in United, filed online report, no response"

0,"@united ‚Ç¨202.88 is the difference between the booked flights, do you want screen shots?"
0,"@united rebooked 24 hours after original flight, to say your handling of situation was bad would be an understatement."

0,"@united (1/2) thanks, but does not answer my question. I want to make a reservation over the phone in Perth, hold for 24hrs, and have family"
0,@united it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
0,@united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
0,@united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable
0,@united the only difference being you are both responsible and in a position to do something about them. Learn from @Delta
0,@united Yes my flight was rebooked. I'm just losing trust in you if I want to get anywhere on time.
1,"@united thanks, keep up the good work"

0,@united it is cool. Your customer told me they didn't care either. It is expected
0,@United is freaking worthless. I hate this airline. http://t.co/dN1if2cGwE

1,@united sent you my confirmation via DM. Thank you very much

0,@united broke my suitcase &amp; refuses to give me a repair estimate. http://t.co/zOUOwgv3Q6
0,@united How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline?
0,@united can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm
0,@united thanks KP.  What's going on w/4840 tonight.  Bad update online and phone. Can't u give customers good info. Not waste their time?!
1,@united just got my lost Kindle in the mail! Thanks again.
0,@united 4840 You knew this flight was delayed! MHT to ALB to EWR to get crew. Your arrival is Late Flightr than the departure! Update your site!
0,@united 4840 WTF! Why can't you update your times in a timely manner? You've known the fight was more delayed! Ur service is awful! @CNN

0,@united ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ?
0,@united WORST SERVICE EVER. Denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. How hard is it to schedule a gate? @Delta next time.
0,"@united I'm in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here."

0,@united WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!
0,".@united just curious why you'd board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no?"
0,@united just changed again.  This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue http://t.co/A37N3oHOKL

0,@united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.
0,@united silence is very telling

0,@united look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent
1,@united thanks for the reply. I have been in contact with Customer Care to get clarification on this issue.
0,@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
0,"@united How is this considered ""on time"" if it's arriving at destination half hour Late Flightr than scheduled? http://t.co/YMFTw1uyHr"
0,"@united thanks for trying to take my money without notice. In any other industry, you Cancelled Flight a service, a refund is issued. Cont‚Ä¶"
0,@united And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with @united now.

0,@united flight was too heavy so had to fly BACK to Palm Springs (after being in the air for 30 mins)

0,"@united ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail"
0,@united my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A-&gt;B than United Airlines!
0,"@united What happened this afternoon? Huge amt of incoming planes to SFO delayed over 1-2 hours.
Frustrating!"
0,@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place
0,@united can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in Houston airport? Line 3 rows deep 1 person working
1,"@united I'll stick with my United flight. Thanks, though. Effort is much appreciated."
0,"@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute."
0,@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp;underserved
1,"@united Fair enough. I don't usually rant, but it's good to know someone's listening. :)"
0,@united are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ??

0,@united your airline is a joke. 1 person working special services at EWR?!? Line is 15 ppl deep. GROW UP!
0,@united More concerned that you close a club I paid alot for at 10.  Last flight 11:15p.  The construction going on is very inconvenient.
1,@united perfect! Thank you!
0,@united care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining.  A man at 10p at LAX club.  More.....
0,@united smiling? NOT!!

1,@united has the best pilots ever Thank you guys for the great trip #thatisall
0,@united - I really down think downgrading the booze/food selections at the club is a good way to go.  How about you look @aircanada?
0,@united You guys are atrocious.  Far better service as silver on Delta than you as a platinum.  I'll be switching back to delta.
1,@united I will thank you!
1,@united thanks for making sure they hear the message!

0,"@united worried the cold weather or snow would delay us this morning, but no it was the pilots. #stillwaiting"

0,@united My flying United is over...sorry. The Captain still had 20 minutes of pre-flight preparations to make while we sat with no air!
1,"@united yes, Thx! At 10:35 (landed at 9:20)."
0,@united get a clue. I am a 1K/2mm miler and that is the response you give?
0,@united I was only trying to get my emails. What are you talking about? What most business people expect from airline wifi
0,@united it's not there we tried. It's already here in cancun just no one has delivered it
0,"@united what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your ""customer feedback"""
0,@united its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru
0,@united yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
0,@united please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
0,@united nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service?
0,"@united oh no, I'm rebooked, 7+ hours after my original arrival time. We can talk compensation."
0,@united my coworker that had the same conflict as me with the hotel issue trying to share posted on their facebook page and they erased it!!
0,"@united lost my parents luggage to cancun, said it would be delivered to hotel by 7PM, it is now almost 11PM"
0,@united then watched my connecting flight in DEN pull away from the gate only to pull into THE SAME gate. #SlapInTheFace
0,"@united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We'll wait."
0,@United I'm pretty sure I've got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way...
0,@united well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary
0,@united can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You've Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me.
0,@united &amp; I've been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now
0,"@united 2 hour flight from FLL to Ewr, 1242, now waiting 1 hour plus for bags, no sign yet. What gives????"
0,@united was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!!
0,@united this is despicable I spoke to  many diff people &amp; everyone is telling me something different I have a claim no. I need my bag now
0,@united how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight.
0,"@united Funny thing happened, we arrived on our flight from Denver at the same gate we are currently scheduled to depart for Sydney at! LOL!"
1,@united I forgot that Intl flights out of LAX don't go from Intl Terminal! Easiest re-check in ever! woo!
0,"@united you can't claim ""weather"" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won't"
0,"@united you're missin the point! There was no ""weather"". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim ""weather"" to get out of hotels. Classy"
0,@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
1,"@united Okay, thank you for your help :)"
0,@united this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain
1,@united thanks
0,@united I bet @SouthwestAir doesn't turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time
1,"@United is the best way to re-unite me with my one true love, shopping in USA's fashion capital #NewYork #unitedVUSA http://t.co/rBn7StUij1"
0,@united final destination was booked through United but with quantas. United has not yet contacted Auckland. I am unaware of case ID number

1,"@united okay - thanks for your help, JT! I appreciate your time!"
0,@united screwed over my professor. Maybe we should tell everyone about @Skiplagged ? #aviation #airport #airline #innovation #startups #tech
0,@united @staralliance Now do the right thing and reinstate the tickets you voided #UnitedFail
0,@united negative. Done wasting time with amateurs at customer service. Thanks for at least offering.
1,"@united @staralliance was there few weeks ago AWESOME,bright vibrant, and NO habitrails"
1,"@united no worries - after everyone boarded, the cushions were brought in. Took a while, but they made it here."
1,"@united Very good flight, thank you!"
0,@united can you DM me? Been on hold with customer service very long time (53 min +) and getting the run-around. Thanks.
0,@united I'm asking if you can simplify the communications- thx
1,"@united yes #LHRT2 lounge is fantastic, if only the US ones could be remotely similar!"
0,@United OMG WHERE IS MY BAG??? YYZUA70435 - enough with the shenanigans already. It's getting real old real quick!!
0,@united how long will it take for miles that i re-purchased (they had expired) to show up? I recieved an email that the request had been..
0,@united Please stall flight 1535 out of ORD. I have to get to SNA tonight.
1,"@united Thanks, I will!"
0,@united can you get a gate for UA4727?  Turrible.
0,@united is the worst airline. Lost my luggage delayed my flights and has been very unaccomidating
1,@united is officially my favorite airline. They have created magic for me all day!!! #friendlyskies #careyon
1,"@united we had a wonderful flight attendant named Leah that was with us from lga to den, then den to anchorage!"
1,@united I was protected on that flight by gate agent Kerry at LAS. She also did an excellent job getting me to my destination today. Thanks!
1,"@united Your staff, both on deck and in the cabin on UA768 SFO -&gt; BOS were exceptional today. Please tell them well done :)"
0,@united I mean is there a real live person somewhere I can go and speak to at Newark post security?
0,@united i have talked to them...on standby for tomorrow but it doesn't look good. May have to stay here till Friday &amp; that's not guaranteed
0,@united plz don't advertise wifi if it's not gonna work thanks #worstflightever
0,"@united Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times."
0,@united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.
0,@united hello. I'm overseas &amp; my bag is lost. I can't call customer service but can you help me?
1,"@united landing in anchorage, then on our way to fairbanks! http://t.co/FjkvQMbmaS"
0,@united I knew I should've flew @VirginAmerica lol
0,"@united, UA1641 EWR-MCO 17 Feb wifi never connected but allowed me to purchase access twice &amp; charged me. Who do I need to file claim with?"
1,@united thnx
1,"@united 
I will admit, you've been rather good to me over the years.
You've still got me hooked.
(for now!)
Peace."
1,@united it's kinda funny. No worries.
0,@united My feedback and concerns via your site aren‚Äôt going to improve my poor airport experiences.
0,@united just dropped bags at Newark. Your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person I have met. Even my two children were shocked!
1,@united great. Looking forward to your response to my DM then
0,"@united It was quite enjoyable. üòä 

Except now he's stuck on the runway in Houston. üòï"
1,@united thank you for getting our daughter home when @americanair Cancelled Flightled all their flights to Nashville
1,"@united thanks for the re-upgrade to 1st class. It may be a 45 min flight, but it is appreciated."
0,"@united makes total sense, except flight wasn't full :) I've got empty seats around me &amp; overheads were more than half open when I boarded."
0,@united now we are trying to get to San Juan from Chicago O'Hare. Having lots of problems. May get a standby flight.
0,"@united well sorta....we r trying to get to Aquadilla, PR but only 1 flight goes there a day. All are booked. UA Cancelled Flighted our flight to NJ"
0,@united why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on http://t.co/8FMZZOltv9 costs $165 #customerservicefail
1,@united @parryaftab done thnx
0,"@united, I'm still frustrated I gave up my seat &amp; the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. http://t.co/KvfwajVViD"
0,"@united gotta love giving up 1st class upgrade b/c flight delayed, to get another flight (also delayed) just to ensure I make my connection."
0,"@united Not sure what happened @ MSP yesterday, but VERY UNHAPPY my bag was not only delayed, but sat at MSP for 8 hrs b4 delivery @ 2:30 am"
0,@united I'm flying @AmericanAir on the way back. I rarely fly them but let's see if they are any better....
0,@united it's almost like we're punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good
1,"@united Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I'm sure it's just cosmetic."
0,"@united thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights, it's crazy"
1,"@united #1007 Houston-Bogota boarding again, safety first, it seems the mechanics fixed the problem faster, good energy to fly home/family"
0,@united no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
1,@united have reported it.  Still in Istanbul at the moment apparently.  On the other plane haha.  Hats off to the pilot!
1,"@united hey awesome!  Thanks for the reply, will be filling the form out! @AmericanAir"
0,@united flying tomorrow from mexico to US. Mileage tkts dont show 1k status. Help
0,@united correct date is 2/11/15!
0,@united 3 phone reps. None could see I was rebooked so missed that flight.Told to go standby for a nonexistent Late Flightr flight. Did I hurt you?
0,@united a report was filed with the airport police on 11th and 12th February-I have the police case number if required
0,"@united can't DM, you're not following. LLY144. Rebooked on #UA1516 but still need seats."
0,@united the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us
0,@united 1 hour since boarding began and we're still sitting at the gate.  #UA507
0,@united Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight &amp; insufficient ground crew to handle
0,@united took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rV0blxs
1,"@united they are all -pilots, FA and ground personnel doing a great job. Weather is to blame... Who do I talk to about that :)"
0,"@united I find this text funny, considering we are still sitting here because 2 seats need to be changed out. http://t.co/LoLuWfCi11"
0,"@united #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem, mechanics trying to ""fix"" the problem, safety first, better to change the plane"
0,@united thanks! Makes sense. Just annoying that it can't be determined better.
0,@united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline
0,@united idea: if u don't want us to be frustrated don't Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber
0,@united I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight
0,@united I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn't arrive until 6:07
0,@united please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 February 2014 at Albuquerque airport
0,@united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
0,@united I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine
0,@united thanks I'll fill out the form that no one reads or responds to.
0,@united I was patient when they refused to switch my flight Bc of my checked bag then Cancelled Flightled the one I was on
0,"@united   sent DM last week, re: suit regarding your error. No response was given. Please Answer DM or tell me who to send suit to...."
1,@united Will have to try standby in Denver tonight or will have to Cancelled Flight father son trip till next year. Thx for trying.
0,@united I wrote to you but got nothing.and I am out of US .It is very simple thing.Will ypu provide compensation for your delay?
0,"‚Äú@united: @qlyss8 We don't want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JT‚Äù A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one."
0,@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please!
0,@united nope. Really. No window at all for 10A. 10F has one. 8 and 11 has one. None for 10A. So sad...
0,"@united #vegan meals can be more creative than noodles, peas, and zukes. Non-vegan yogurt is not acceptable for a vegan. Can you do better?"
1,"@united well, thanks for not charging me for switching my two Cancelled Flightled flights anyway. That was pretty nice. #stillmakingmepoorthough"
1,@united well it IS John Hughes' birthday. But I will stick w the plane &amp; hold off on trains &amp; automobiles. Gate workers are doing well.
0,@united - my son left his tablet on plane.  Am out of country and can not call easily.  Is there an email to contact?
0,"I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... @united"
0,@united all i hear is blah blah blah ....you shoulda used that $400 to buy a @burningman ticket instead. &amp; ill be driving there not flying
0,"@united yes, supposed to be here by 6PM. I have a Board Meeting tomorrow. Fingers crossed."
0,@united thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr!
1,@united thank you! Love united!! Have 4 flights today!
1,"@united Just did, thanks for checking! :)"
0,@united just informed you don't reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you
0,"@united Midland couldn't get our bags to connect on our Intl flight to Sydney, so have to get em in LA &amp; check em in there."
0,@united this may be the last time I fly your airline.
0,"@united Is your company motto: ""I do not care!!!""  I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week.""  #idonotcare"
0,@united you should tell that to the staff at LAX then. I boarded group 5 at the very end of the queue as a Gold member. Thanks for nothing.
0,"@united Missing crew, passenger doc problems, frozen toilets, and now we're off the plane. Give me my money back.  UA3466"
1,@united Fantastic job by your people today on ua22 from Dublin. A jam packed plane but the crew was wonderful!!
0,"@united there was 20 min to departure, no one waiting. On being pressed ground staffer threatened ""do you want to get to SF today"" #fail"
0,@united flying lax to Sfo and system won't let me check in. Your site tells me to do it through @AirCanada and they tell me through you.
0,"@united and btw, the @Virgin and @JetBlue managed on time departures same time same destination- &amp; wouldn't take away a 9year old kids bag!"
1,@united can I just go ahead and live in your premium cabins? I'm in heaven now en route to LHR
0,"@united feeling poor on the church-mouse level here, 180 dollars is enough to make a grown man cry. I'm not a grown man but tears happened"
0,@united sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!
0,@united UA6002 MLI-&gt;DEN. Will miss connection UA3530 DEN-&gt;YEG due to delay.
0,"@united How come you are the ONLY airline, of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. Not even gate check...baggage claim?!?"
0,@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
0,@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
0,@united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards
0,"@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter."
0,"@united Flight was overbooked! Was offered voucher to wait &amp; take another flight. Gate agent switched me over, retracted voucher offer."
1,@united thank you!
1,@united Thanks - it's very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates.
0,@united As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.
0,"@united airlines claims to have a low fare guarantee, but they won't honor a lower fare that I found."
0,@united Another delayed United flight. I should not be this surprised or upset. I'm mostly disappointed I have to Cancelled Flight my trip with my dad
0,"@united still can't dm, it's LH7631 on 21/2/15"
1,@united Thank you Margo at Houston's Bush Intercontinental for getting me home earlier.
0,"@united, I booked our flights w/ @WestJet. I saw the same prices each time I searched. It wasn't the least bit frustrating. #customerservice"
0,"@united, Thanks, but I didn't want to see 'we've started your flight search over' OR 'the fare &amp; rules for this itinerary has changed' again"
0,@united my cats flight was delayed 1+hour  she will be arriving to Hawaii after 5 &amp; I won't be able to pick her up until tomorrow üò≠
0,"@united I did not, my mind was on getting to the next flight."
0,@united now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.
0,@united What's up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+.  Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail
0,@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn‚Äôt exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
0,@united I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees
0,"@united Thanks, but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1M)."
0,@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do?
1,"@united sweet, follow back and I'll get the dm off"
1,@united all good! Next flight was a little delayed so it all worked üëç
0,"@united Just boarded UA1297, was refused from carrying overhead bag as no space, in plane now with loads of space #fail #customerexperience"
0,@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
0,@united Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn't work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :(
0,"@united Nice ""partners"" you have. The delays keep increasing every 20 min @FtLauderdaleSun @orlandosentinel http://t.co/1AtEafnC6R"
0,@united UA1740 just admit you have no clue when flight will leave Denver. #unfriendlyskies
0,"@united yep, after long waiting on the phone we managed to rebook it. Hope it will be a pleasent one. Thanks for ur help."
0,@united Just had the worst experience ever flying with you
0,@United UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You've been doing this for 2 hrs.
0,@united why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating!
0,"@united my plane sounds like  a DJ  scratching is this normal? If so, will this eventually be a new entertainment fee."
0,"@united how can i trust United with future Flight Booking Problemss when a confirmed, ticketed and purchased ticket is Cancelled Flightled after the fact?"
0,@united rebooked.  This one is Late Flight too.
0,@united 2nd Late Flight flight today
0,"@united if u miss first leg of ur flight, you have to pay hundreds of $'s just to keep your second leg? How much to keep my earned miles?"

1,@united I am blown away by stellar #custserv !! Thank you &lt;3 http://t.co/JOrEScfb4x
0,@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
0,@united a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn't delayed due to frozen water lines.
0,@united annnnddddd I'm going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to
1,@united you have the nicest gate attendant at Newark airport gate 101 right now. Multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone.
0,@united 6 hour mechanical delay...killing me
0,@united every time I check a bag with your airline I'm confident I will be wearing the same clothes for 3 days.  Please prove me wrong.
0,@united. Thanks United for the no running water and Late Flight flight from Grand Rapids to Denver
0,@united KN: not allowing me to bypass the receipt # on the refund request form. Never received receipt email. charged http://t.co/Cju102xP2k
0,@united When will that happen? It really confuses when the 1st content to come on the 6in screens is about how technology forward United is.
0,"@united you mean like my mailing address and rate? By the surliness of my United ""coworkers"" I'm guessing our benefits aren't great."
0,@united I already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. I'm speechless at your system
0,@united just because you are a monopoly in @flySFO doesn't mean you treat your frequent fliers like crap.
0,"@united Yeah, bag is on the way. As per usual.  I'm actually getting used to getting it delivered to me, its kind of nice in a sense."
0,@united Why does it take 4-6 weeks for a new MileagePlus Premier card to be sent out? #stillwaiting #doesntfeellikestatusyet
0,"@United Wonder why people hate dealing with airlines?  Ridiculous and inflexible ""policies"".  I need a phone number and a resolution.  Now."
0,@united LE2V9D pnr numbered flight. The first leg is Cancelled Flightled due to bad weather in iatanbul. How can i make a reFlight Booking Problems
0,"@united (2/2) It suggests that if can't confirm cert at time of Flight Booking Problems, I should assume that it may never clear. Didn't used to be that way"
1,"@united Thanks for explanation. It seems like an odd incentive structure, tho, because it dramatically diminishes the value of the certs."
0,"2/2 @united You don't really care about our comfort, you care about profitability. That's fine, just own up to it. #unfriendlyskies"
0,1/2 @united Just be honest with your customers. The new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane. More rows = more money.
0,@united missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool
0,@united Designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? The article says the latter #unfriendlyskies
0,"@united what do you think missing meetings is worth?  A flight voucher?  I fly all the time, so what would make it right?"
0,"@United and @DirectTV. Not to pile on, but it's time to update your in flight TV package. http://t.co/Lug4MFVWsA"
0,@united  why is it so hard to add in meal preferences AFTER I booked tickets? I forgot to do it &amp; it's now impossible! I even called.

0,@united you are lightyears ahead of the security control at Newark airport. They wasted 40 precious mins w bad efficiency. #frightening
1,"@united Great, thank you!"
0,@united 1627 to Montego Bay going back to gate bc 1person was Late Flight? Awful service for all of who came on time!!
0,@united right... Are you guys charging for the air we breathe next?
0,"@united in other words... sorry, not sorry.  Plenty of other airlines... and I travel A LOT."

0,@united this is getting ridiculous. Now we're missing our connection.
0,@united Couldn't use the confirmed upgd cert you gave me b/c you decided to sell anyone a biz seat for $299. Why do you bother giving them?
0,@united I locked myself out of my account and needed access to book a flight.
0,@united any chance you can troubleshoot check ins at @FlyYOW ? We're at 20 minutes per person.
0,@united how on earth could you close the united club in Atlanta? What a major #fail at an airport of this size
1,@united sorry to hear outsourcing plan. Boise is best staff/cust service in the country. #boise

0,"@united if you're listening, why are you the lowest provider of inflight wifi? Get with the times!"

0,"@united @laurasbrown5 What does ""dealing via email"" have anything to do with a crappy web form that is not made for mobile devices"
0,"@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen Next thing you know, United will believe they are above the DOT and take them to court. United is anti-consumer"
0,@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen I read that last hashtag as Go F United. Makes sense since they F us by Cancelled Flightling ticketed reservations
1,@united You delayed a connection for customer service today now I'll be able to pay my final respects to a dear family member. Thank you :)
0,@united @gg8929 I'm sorry United isn't able to keep its word 'cuz their IT is totally inadequate but they still says it's a customer fault!
0,@united How can you not know where my bags are?  You knew where they were 6 hours ago. You are killing me!  Worst service. Ever.
0,@united Stop pretending you care about the welfare of my daughter. United Airlines had the opportunity to help n failed # United airlines
0,@united I have received one previously on the 11th having checked. Odd as you said there was no complaint associated with my e-mail?
0,"@united ok, I have that, pretty sure I had it before too but will wait and see what happens...."
0,@united Checking tracing information. You got 2 numbers wrong in my phone number &amp; how did a turquoise duffle bag become a black laptop bag?
0,@united  treats service members like crap never flying again with them #UnitedAirlines  @CNN
0,@united What is the point of a UPC code on checked baggage if you can't tell me where my luggage is? Vacation- day 3: trying on swimsuits...
0,@united why are your SFO-&gt;BOS nonstop flights not competitively priced with those of JetBlue and Virgin? $179 vs $324. Identical times.
0,@united how come I have no baggage updates.
0,"@united Thanks for your response. Bags came, but it was a long wait and priority tags weren't honored at all. Disappointing"

0,@united are my bags here yet?  They were at Palm Springs airport.  I was at LAX.  How come I beat my bags here.
0,@united why couldn't you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?
0,@united A generic form with tons of fields asking for info you already?  Expected more as a premier platinum. Another #servicefail
0,"@united, wtf is your username and/or email addr signin STILL unavailable? Been trying to login since Sunday"
0,@united I want my bags. There is vital equipment in there. You are royally screwing me. I'm cranky and want an update.
1,@united you guys have such big hearts.. keep up the good work
0,@united Flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. I was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology
0,"@united I am VERY disappointed with @SilverAirways as your partner. No communication, 2 extremely Late Flight flights. Really, all around horrible."
0,"@united unless it's on you guys, im good."

0,"@united missed connection, wrong city, bags at Palm Springs, but not at hotel. I am seriously tired of being treated this way."

0,@united still haven't received a response. Please direct message me for my contact information.
0,@united I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!

0,@united RTB&gt;IAH 2/17 First class. My wife (Global Services) and I had headaches due to our neighbors smoking e cigarettes. Contact me pls
0,"@united ""federal regulation prohibits you being separated from your bag""...yet you lose our bag and that's okay"
0,@united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...
0,@united do you guys have any working planes?
0,@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
0,"@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won‚Äôt fix it."
0,@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!
0,@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
1,"@united That made me so mad, but then I called the bag number, and that person was helpful and told me where the bag really was. (2/2)"
0,"@united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2)"
1,@united The only thing you fella have done right today is get me to the pacific time zone.
0,@united Ugh.  My bags were sent to Palm Springs and not to LAX as promised.  They better be at the hotel when I get there.
0,"@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back"
0,"@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months"
0,@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
1,@united big up the pilot of 644 for turning 1hr on the tarmac to just a 20min delayed arrival
0,@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou
0,@united my golf bag didn't have a top cover + staffers said they couldn't check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag...

0,@united once again my bag is lost when I travel united!!!! Please do something
0,@united Stuck on plane for over an hour due to mechanical faults. Any updates please? This happened on way to Newark and now again to LHR...
0,@united - flight 1114. Unfortunately this isn't an isoLate Flightd incident. I haven't waited less than 20min in years
0,@united did I mention one bag is an infant car seat &amp; we've been stuck with yr poor replacement on icy mtn roads
0,"@united this is in ur Hemispheres magazine. I'm open to what will u do to make the ""flight more pleasant."" http://t.co/VrQDpqEPFW"
0,@united hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day.
0,"@united it's Late Flight... I'm tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn't chipper, but I def was not rude."
0,"@united rude cust ser agents busy chatting, then yelled bc I took pic. Put me stdby when seat. Diff agent gave me seat 30min Late Flightr. Platinum"
0,"@united I am a frequent user. Congrats u only lost my bags once in 20 years. Problem, it was today and your staff were rude!üò¢ still no bag!"
1,@united Sivi Stewart at Lax was fantastic tonight helping to find a lost item for us at the airport.  Much thanks!
0,"@united Yes, though they have not located the bag yet. It was a lovely flight outside of that."
1,@united Got me home amid snow &amp; Cancelled Flightlations; delivered bag w/o hassle; plus no wait on phone &amp; an upgrade. Thank you!
0,"@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result."
0,@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
0,"@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know"
0,@united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.
0,"@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?"
0,"@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won‚Äôt fix it?"
0,"@united so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they won‚Äôt fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to go‚Ä¶?"
0,@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
0,@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
0,@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
0,@united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD
1,"Cc @DadBoner  #boldflavors ‚Äú@united: We‚Äôre bringing Bourbon St. to 35,000 ft. with bold flavors, fresh ingredients and more dining options"""
0,@united thx for checking in. Never got through via phone. On hold over hour. How long is too long to wait on hold? Ugh. #csfail
0,@united how else would I know it was denied?
0,"@united You allow shady 3rd party services to sell your tickets and then refuse to help the customer, who's left holding the bag.
#flyunited"
0,@united Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice

0,@united 3875 to Denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land
0,@united I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had this many issues with any other airline.
0,@united haha that's fine. Still won't fly @united ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else.
0,@united note: they are traveling w 2yr old. Unreal
0,@united and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY
1,@united and they were traveling as guests of a mileage plus member using that members miles. Great customer service.
0,@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf
0,"@united I'm on one of your 757-300 between JFK and LAX.When r u upgrading planes?Plane has no Screens,lousy seats And that's in UnitedFirst."
1,"@United Bringing your ""A"" game with premium cabin dining. Nice! https://t.co/zgOQoxjBQY"
0,@united you already have vomit so you are halfway there
0,@united is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !!
0,"@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff"
0,@united they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people.
0,@united you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver
0,"@united time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United"
0,"@united it was an international flight, and we didn't get our new eta until we were in the air."
1,@united - I think she was having a rough moment w/ a bad passenger from an earlier flight. Things got considerably better. Thanks!
0,@united - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings. Hello @Delta !
0,"@united Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out."
1,"@united awesome. Thx. And thx for replying so damn fast, sure as hell beats 80s cheeze hold music!!"
0,@united $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse?
0,@united @gg8929 Unbelievable hypocrisy!!
1,@united thanks for not getting my BusinessFirst priority tagged bag onto my connecting flight at EWR despite a 2+ hour layover. Nice job
1,"@united amazing flying over 25,000 miles on #UnitedAirlines &amp; alliance last year; still got jilted out of status! #moneyelsewhere"
0,"@united On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this."
0,@united now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse...
0,"@united thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain"
0,@united The third wheelchair is broken! http://t.co/tvk0PyxQv5
1,"@united She met me from customer service at the arrival of flight UA3787 PVD-IAD. Thanks, you guys have really handled this storm!"
1,@united ooh thanks!
0,"@united my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55."
0,@united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable
0,@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
0,I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.
0,"@united @annricord 0162431184663.
3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket."
0,@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
0,@united IT-problems with the link? #3thparty
0,"@United: I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. http://t.co/FuCHZRZjg5"
0,@united Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me
0,@united can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting....
1,@united thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
0,@united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup
0,@united Your MileagePlus signup page is broken.
0,@united $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I'm gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours...
0,@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
0,"@united so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67"
0,@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun
0,@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!
0,@united can you not see the thread?
0,@united poor old United: never seem to get the response right :)
0,@united obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport
0,@united also why can't I pre-select seats on SFO-&gt;YYZ flight? I'm a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on http://t.co/aZltJhf7lv.
1,@united thanks! :)
0,"Hypocrisy RT @united @gg8929 I'm sorry, we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP"
0,@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL
0,@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
0,@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
0,@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.
0,@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
0,@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.
0,"@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!"
0,"@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united."
0,@united I'm 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn't bad!üëéüëé
0,@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
0,@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!
0,@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp; USA on United with only Nexus
0,"@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!"
0,@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection?
0,@united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ
0,"@united Call customer service and of course they just say ""theres nothing we can do"" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line."
0,"@united Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks"
0,@united if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for?
0,@united Classic
1,@united Elizabeth at Washington Dulles just hooked me up with a new connecting flight at my gate! I'm super pleased!
1,@united Thanks!
0,@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
0,@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.
0,"@united thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to ""fly"" united"
0,@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
0,@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
0,@united @gg8929 so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn't like the exchange rate? #doublestandards
0,"@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?"
0,@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
0,@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
0,@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
0,@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
0,@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
0,@united I'll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed.
0,@United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(
1,@united JT thanks for your help I‚Äôll complete the form once we are back home
0,"@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight..."
1,@united You might be dealing with frustrated passenegers. hope you all have a great day :) thank you very much for an amazing airline :)
0,@united yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !
0,@united thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive.
0,@united But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty.
0,"@united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times.
If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous."
0,@united you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond
0,@united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service
0,"@united here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It's ok!"
0,@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
1,@united thank you! I wish the lady in Little Rock had told me that in the morning when I asked her
0,@united no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?
1,"@united Thank you for the speedy response! I figured it may be something of that nature. You guys and your ""fine print,"" haha"
0,@united worst service ever üòà
0,@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
0,@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
0,@united I am furious.  You're firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United
1,@united holy high speed internet batman!  Speeds at United Club at IAD are insanely fast!  Thanks
0,@united Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.

0,"@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck"
0,@united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
0,"@united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight."
0,@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines.
0,@united it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.
0,@united I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.

0,"@united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation"
0,@united i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded.  Nothing got refunded as of yet
0,@united So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm stranded away from home and work?
0,@united you are really trying me today.
1,@united looks like I'm settled in to where I'm going.  Thx.
0,@united no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition.
0,@united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting
0,@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
0,"@united flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta"
1,"@united Thanks, ^KP. Please also mention the Quiche breakfast and Tandoori chicken dinner entrees and accompaniments are truly First Class."
0,@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?
0,@united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.
0,@united who can tell me where they are?
0,"@united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful."
0,@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
0,@united flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she'd been txting on
0,@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude
0,@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.
0,@united I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no comp seats
0,@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
0,@united thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn't miss my transfer...
0,@united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success.
0,"@united I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home."
0,@united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
0,@united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.

0,@united Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it.
0,@united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can't?
1,@United WiFi onboard 737-800 far superior in pricing and performance (user-perceived bandwidth and Late Flightncy) to recent @GoGo experiences.
0,@united Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!
0,@united when is my plane coming?  Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane.

1,"@united @FlyANA_official pleasantly surprised to find ANA has made major upgrades on their transpacific route in flights, planes and service"
0,@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
0,"@united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation."
0,.@united we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating.
1,"@united no worries about the tweets. We all should do what we can to make sure we, as in your tag line, ""Fly the Friendly Skies."""
1,@united @jsumiyasu I am thankful to the  United ground staff who put me in the last seat on the last flight out. Home Late Flight is still home!

0,@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?

0,"@southwestair excruciatingly slow internet on SWA flights is now the norm, rather than the exception. Is this being addressed?"
0,@SouthwestAir The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad.
0,"@SouthwestAir the sign in screen had major mobile issues, the responsive design wasn't working properly my Nexus 5."
0,@SouthwestAir sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it?

0,@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
0,@JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?
0,@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?
0,"@JetBlue - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)"

1,@JetBlue you bet:)
0,@JetBlue Sure did go south after breakfast though! Delayed three hours. :( :( :(
1,@JetBlue thank you. Appreciate that!!
1,@JetBlue The chairs could use some TLC. And more power outlets in the area would be a bonus. Headed to @UniversalORL !
1,@JetBlue Thanks. Used phone instead of computer and it worked!! Thx again!
0,@JetBlue someone should screen what you play on your flights. http://t.co/tNY9uIpha5
0,"@JetBlue For one way, not letting me select TO city....strange...and now some fairs look ""normal"" ????"
1,"alright @JetBlue.... done! alternatively, if you'd like to charter a private jet for me to PITT i will gladly accept :)"
0,@JetBlue great job getting flight 28 in 10 minutes early. Too bad we're at 50 minutes and counting waiting for our bags.
0,"@JetBlue I believe it's Irina. On the flip-side, super disappointed that EatUp Cafe isn't available on this BOS --&gt; SFO flight today."
0,"@JetBlue All good, I just have 2 remind myself that if this was 1914 I might be on a horse &amp; buggy. So what's a little delay right."

1,"@JetBlue @jeff_hofmann @DeniseJTaylor @LaurieAMeacham Good one! And indeed, it's JetBlue's finest day in history!"
0,"@JetBlue nope. The ""regular"" line was multi-x faster. You literally direct all the wheelchairs and strollers into the same line as EMS."
1,@JetBlue thanks! Calling right now!
0,"@JetBlue Thank you, but that isn't really responding to my request, is it? You are sending me into a generic environment on your site."
0,"@JetBlue I would like to communicate directly with a ""Customer Experience"" executive. Does Joanna Geraghty have an email address?"
1,@JetBlue Haha. Thanks. You guys are great. Unlike the @nyjets. ;-) #GoPatriots!

1,@JetBlue thank you!!
0,@JetBlue  any effort to fix your points system? 11 days and a call to customer service and still no account update. Chasing points is no fun
0,"@JetBlue I tried! Had me running from curb-side to self-check &amp; wasting even more time. Ended up Flight Booking Problems United for $$$, am so upset"
0,@JetBlue keeps getting better. No water on the plane.

0,@JetBlue what is the deal with flt 460 today? Departure keeps changing. When is it going why is it so Late Flight?
0,"@JetBlue lol at your ""estimated departure time."" Plane hasn't even started boarding yet. You can't even get your delays right."
0,"@JetBlue @martysg you *know* how I love you, JB, but honestly, when you have complex feedback, those pull-down sub-option forms=maddening."
0,"@JetBlue said they haven't started looking for it, gave me a $25-$100 limit. In NYC at the Waldorf Astoria and can't find $100 outfit. üòí"
0,@JetBlue yeah I'm aware of that. Hence my original msg to you.
0,@JetBlue 653. Just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal. Airline is a disaster.
0,@JetBlue no I asked. Either way it doesn't make the flight less delayed.
1,@JetBlue 2324 from Orlando to Dca ! And my awesome flight attendant is Robert!
0,"@JetBlue Yes, I filed yesterday around noon. I have a claim number but they haven't contacted me yet."
0,@JetBlue shocker my flight delayed an hour. Thanks for reminding me why I switched to delta.

0,"@JetBlue Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting ""Webpage not available"" after submitting online form"
0,@jetblue are going to let Fl382 into a gate in BOS any time soon? We're just sittin' here on the tarmac  waiting.
1,"@JetBlue Thanks JB. Actually, As a birder I love them too. They just need to be outside. It shouldn't be too hard to trap and move them."
0,@JetBlue not an issue but I think training &amp; information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better
0,"@JetBlue Rats, that's a bummer!"
0,@JetBlue is so sloooooow today
1,"@JetBlue flight from JFK-SFO was pure awesomeness. Mint Class and Tim our attendant was the best! Other airlines, take notes!"

1,@JetBlue thank you for getting me home. And despite all odds I have reunited with my delinquent Southwest luggage. Now homeward
0,"@JetBlue 2 words: ""staff training."" What a joke-"
0,@JetBlue is a joke. Missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Last flight of the day and they don't hold it.  5 minutes.
0,@JetBlue any idea what's going on at terminal five at JFK? Seems to be zero traffic movement
0,"@JetBlue Very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept. I nearly had to beg get just for a ""courtesy report"""
1,@JetBlue ok thanks. Safety first.
0,@JetBlue apparently the plane was delayed coming up from San Juan. Monsoon there today?
0,@JetBlue over 2 hour delay going from NYC to Denver! Come on man!
0,@JetBlue @amybruni @DIRECTTV No Oscars on Direct TV on this flight. We were so looking forward to it. We were devastated. :-/
0,"@JetBlue - Fix your @#$&amp; jet bridges.  40 minute delay, 2nd gate...still waiting!  #jetblues http://t.co/ncB2oNcS9i"
1,Kudos well deserved! Just wish the rest of my @JetBlue experience today measured up to their example!
1,"@JetBlue ha ha! Can I get a wake up call at boarding time please?  Large coffee, extralight extra sweet please!"
0,@JetBlue didn't work. Fly-fi plus couldn't access ABC app. So I spent $19 and still missed Oscars. #disappointed
0,@JetBlue üëç. I think I'll come take a nap at the terminal.  ;)
0,@JetBlue Safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not.
0,@JetBlue #611 from JFK to LAS still delayed?
0,"@JetBlue the lack of TV made it rough, that's literally why I picked y'all over the competitors."
0,@JetBlue But not reddit? I work for the site and this is ridiculous.

0,@JetBlue aka take stuff out of the checked bag! Then just carry on the extra weight. For someone just had shoulder surgery that's just no
1,"@JetBlue pilot: ""Don't worry folks there's a backup for the backup for every part of this plane."" Thanks guy"
0,@JetBlue Can you take @Cosmopolitan off your blacklist... trying to work :(
0,"@JetBlue ""Goodwill"" now at $125.00.  $27,000 x ? = Fine   Still want your new CEO to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 136"

0,@JetBlue hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this
0,@JetBlue had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome!
0,"@JetBlue even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people?"
0,@JetBlue I thought being a mosaic member had 'perks' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs I'm carrying it on üòí
0,@JetBlue are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous
0,@JetBlue  if only the show was on the flight.  No ABC.  Oh well.  I'll live.  #nexttime #andthewinneris...

0,"@JetBlue the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn't make up for the money lost."
0,@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
0,@JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.
0,"Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9"
1,@JetBlue you're still the best
1,"@JetBlue @ABCNetwork please give JetBlue all the permissions in the world! I'm missing the oscars right now, and it's awful #whyabcwhy"
0,@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
0,@JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
1,@JetBlue Thanks!  I made it üòÉ
0,"@JetBlue after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible!"
1,@JetBlue thanks for the quick response! Fingers crossed the plane gets here then
0,"@JetBlue @julesdameron ""Considering?"" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality"
0,@JetBlue how do we watch the oscars though right now?! No abc on flight :( #missingtheoscars
1,@JetBlue Thank you. Fingers crossed.
0,".@JetBlue ooookay @ABC that's silly of you. guess we're ""watching"" the oscars purely on Twitter reactions tonight. #oscars"
0,@JetBlue I've heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay. I thought that was impossible &amp; certainly not EMV compliant
0,"@JetBlue 2nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. Last time I wasn't allowed to fly stndby, now a 2 hour delay w/out notification"
0,@JetBlue oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ http://t.co/7gB0hgW51t
0,@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
0,@jetblue I'm dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given
0,@JetBlue  I did.  They have no idea where it is.
0,@JetBlue thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. üòâ Can I tweet at the TSA??
0,"@JetBlue hey JetBlue.  Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9'8"" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports."
0,@JetBlue your gif game is strong.
0,@JetBlue well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ML1JaCpmch
0,@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
0,@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying
0,@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
0,@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether
0,@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
0,@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
0,"@JetBlue okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break"
1,"@JetBlue aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then!"
0,@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not.
0,@JetBlue 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp; worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day.
0,@JetBlue just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I'll be able to go home!
0,@JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
0,@JetBlue thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned.
0,@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.
1,‚Äú@JetBlue: @FinleyBklynCFS So glad to hear. Thanks for sharing the video.‚Äù Me and JetBlue are #BFF üôè
1,@JetBlue thanks for the response. We are hopeful.
0,@JetBlue Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed
0,@JetBlue thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks
0,@JetBlue all day
0,@JetBlue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.
0,@JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
0,@JetBlue thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back
0,@JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
0,@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
0,@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
1,@JetBlue thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter. Excellent customer service and focus
0,"@JetBlue yes, please get me the seats we paid for."
0,@JetBlue Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi
1,@JetBlue thanks for help. Can't wait to travel with! And get out of the snow.
0,"@JetBlue I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper."
0,"FYI, @JetBlue: The last email response - ""we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you"" -but hope 2 wlcm u back onbrd N the future...   nice touch. lol"
0,"@JetBlue last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal."
1,@JetBlue thanks for answering my questions!
0,@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
0,@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
0,@JetBlue I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue
0,"@JetBlue Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger"
0,@JetBlue anything serious I should worry about?
1,@JetBlue cool! Are there stairs at JFK? I can walk short distances but not stairs.
0,@JetBlue Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx
0,"@JetBlue Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a"
0,@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.
0,"@JetBlue sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated."
0,@JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj
0,"@JetBlue, thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot"
0,@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
0,@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
0,"@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail"
0,@JetBlue do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu
0,"@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your ""terms"" response is insulting.  #jetblue"
0,@JetBlue What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
0,"@JetBlue if you can't guarantee parents will sit with their children, don't sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/HDoXiM6NZ2"
0,@JetBlue once you go blue you don't go back
0,@JetBlue why are there so many delays to north east cities?
0,@JetBlue kids fly. Don't hire people who don't care about them. This guy. #jetblue http://t.co/clvlhfgUZw
0,@JetBlue I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U
0,"@JetBlue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now."
0,@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8
0,"@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting."
1,"@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!"
0,@JetBlue never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2
0,"@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing"
0,@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
0,@JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
0,"@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven"
0,@JetBlue a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4
0,@JetBlue being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue http://t.co/49FLbgzZkd
0,@JetBlue thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable!
0,@JetBlue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday?
0,"@JetBlue no, I haven't done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx!"

0,@JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?
0,@JetBlue I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey.
0,"@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it."
0,@JetBlue our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun.
0,@JetBlue I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.

0,@jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!
0,@JetBlue Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected
0,@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
0,@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
1,"‚Äú@JetBlue: @2littlebirds Well captured, Brittany! We love the clouds! :)  Enjoy the ride!‚Äù Thank you!"

0,"@JetBlue According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet!"

1,@JetBlue thanks! Have a good Sunday.

0,"@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed."

0,@USAirways has the worst customer service. Can't even get through to a rep you gotta be kidding me
0,@USAirways @Beamske But maybe I can be on hold for 30 minutes again. That would be just as amazing.
0,@USAirways @Beamske how about a real live person talk to the person whose luggage was lost for 4 days and vacation wrecked . @yorkshire2002
0,@usairways is your clt departures delayed? Hoping I can make my connection after a lengthy take off delay and endless taxi-ing here at clt
1,@USAirways I'm glad @Beamske retweeted otherwise you would have to ignore the numerous tweets I sent. You all are fucking amazing
0,@USAirways So frustrating because I still have not gotten them back. Why my bag was sent to NY is a mystery!  Shame on me this time!
0,@USAirways I will NEVER travel US Airways again. Flew in from LA to DC last night and for the 2nd time on this airline my bags didn't arrive
1,@USAirways haha no worries you guys are the best!  +1 for spelling my name correctly

1,@USAirways see you on board tomorrow
0,"@USAirways Been on hold for 40 minutes, calling because my flight is delayed.  This type of service in not acceptable."
0,@USAirways been on hold for 2 hours for something which I could have done in less than 1 minute if it was available.Your site UX is awe full
0,@USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50.
0,@USAirways i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online....
0,@USAirways another fiasco at National. Forever from jet to gate on 8:05am flight from RDU
0,"@USAirways - Good to know that your phone customer service is still impaired due to ""bad weather"" that was over a week ago #jetblueanyone?"

0,@USAirways @AmericanAir our honeymoon was delayed a day because a gas cap was not screwed on! Flight 1801- so frustrating!
0,@USAirways Your policy needs a serious revision for babies.  Fortunately I have choices and choose @Southwest from here on out.
0,@USAirways still ignoring my question. #USAirways consistently providing poor customer service.
0,@USAirways they have all of this at hotels. Still don't have my work folder or business casual clothes. #worst http://t.co/JIEYCat1Ek
0,@USAirways oh I got right through to an agent. They just kept putting me on hold and still didn't fix the problem

0,@USAirways should give me free baggage for this mess
0,"@USAirways Gate traffic #DCA, MY flight arrived 20 early,connecting flight 2139 leaving in 23 minutes. Several of us stuck. HOLD THAT PLANE."
0,@USAirways I really feel like your company needs evaluate their policies &amp; realize that transfers should be possible for tickets
0,@USAirways seriously???  did you not see that I've spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours?
1,"@USAirways Waiting on my flight right now, thanks!!"
1,@USAirways We're back at a gate. Opposite of wheels up. Im sure we'll get thete eventually. So thanks.
0,@USAirways. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature!
0,@USAirways 1729 connecting in charlotte to houston. Mechanical issue determined while q'd to take off. And we checked our bags.
0,@USAirways can you DM please in regards to update on lost bag please.
0,@USAirways need to retrain US 3837 lead flight attendant and gate agent at arrival MKE 2/23.  Horrible attitudes toward helping customers.
0,@USAirways Youre batting .1000. Every flight Ive taken is delayed. Worst airline. ever.
1,@USAirways knows customer service!! Thank you for starting our 2 week vacay on an amazing note! Thank you sarita!!!
0,@USAirways why aren't you updating flight status/delays?
0,@USAirways They're also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you're not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out
0,"@USAirways nope, they just announced we're headed back to the gate."
0,@USAirways pretty sure we didn't actually take off at 7:10 http://t.co/vuxf4r4Unu
0,@USAirways well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I've wasted. I've got a job &amp; family this is crazy
0,@USAirways 5203 and we're just sitting 20 feet from an open gate
0,@USAirways just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online

0,@USAirways nope not yet...
0,@usairways I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours.
0,"@usairways My flight was Cancelled Flighted Saturday. Why was my luggage not at the airport? Today, I'm supposed to have it delivered. Pathetic"
0,@usairways  Thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things I already bought.
0,@usairways Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn't have done it without you.
0,@USAirways it's not like I'm trying to leave earlier just for fun. I don't want to get stuck in DC if we have bad weather in RDU.
0,@USAirways some flexibility on your part would be nice. This is why I love @SouthwestAir. They're flexible &amp; not trying to take all my $.
1,@USAirways Excited that I'll be flying from Syracuse to interview in Dallas on Friday for the FA position- this is a goal &amp; dream of mine!
0,@USAirways thank you for reaching out to me. Hopefully my request will be fixed and I can remain a loyal customer.
0,@USAirways it doesn't take 6 days to respond to an already open case!
1,"@usairways great crew for flight 504 PHX to YVR tonight! Friendly, efficient. Awesome job."
0,@USAirways are people going to answer our calls?
0,@USAirways pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail
0,@USAirways : You Make the Reservation; We'll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail
1,@USAirways Thank You for your empathy there is more to this story than just the luggage but thank you for reaching out
0,@USAirways is utterly unreliable! They didn't schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail
0,@USAirways yes but again valuable time has been lost
0,@USAirways I don't like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I've been stuck in CA all day and should've been home by now. You owe me.
0,@USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am.
0,@USAirways the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH
0,@USAirways can't get back lost time
0,@USAirways flt 1820 2rsw could have extended the courtsey of waiting 2min 4 10 of us.... gates closed in r faces.  Ur fired

0,@USAirways my bag landed 1 day Late Flight at sfo at 11:40am. How can it be 10:01pm and I still don't have it? Flight 719 2/22/14
1,@USAirways thanks very much! I got thru on the phone &amp; everything is fine. Just love the website &amp; app ! Thanks for working on it!

0,@USAirways Hi. I'm in LGA but my luggage is in CLT. Have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. Do you guys want to cover my taxi fare?
0,"@USAirways  Instead of fair treatment, I got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death."
0,"@USAirways  A few years ago I lost over 50,000 miles bc I was physically unable to fly during the period.  I submitted a doctor's note."
0,@USAirways  I've never been treated this badly
0,@USAirways  I'm glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems.
0,@USAirways  Three months and my miles haven't been credited.  No one is going to read the email I sent.
0,@USAirways   My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It's been three months and my miles
0,@USAirways   No one picks up the phone all day/  no opportunity to leave a voicemail
0,"@USAirways  Instead, the miles are credited to an account that i did not open
-- My request to merge the accounts is denied"
0,@USAirways No I was there 12 hrs early! Send me an email to share my experience You don't want this blasting here.
0,"@USAirways  I open the credit card and earn 44,000+ miles, and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles"
0,@USAirways  you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card
0,"@USAirways  - I had 20,748 miles in  my account and was informed I'd forfeit them bc of 33 months of inactivity - I"
0,@usairways - It's all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I'm having

0,@USAirways not yet. But we will see shortly.
0,@USAirways I've flown US Airways at least five times. Every single time has been like this. Actions speak louder than words.
0,@USAirways flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel
0,"@USAirways membership has no privileges anymore - my son is in the army, short window to see him - NO help."
0,@USAirways honestly - how is it quickly as possible I've been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else.
0,@USAirways done it! Process initiated Saturday morning.  Can't get info with website issues &amp; inadequate phone coverage.  How 2 get update??
0,@USAirways yay for glitchy tracking system!  My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said!

0,"@USAirways yeah I know that but that doesn't get me my money back does it, everytime I fly with you something bad happens."
1,"BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I MADE IT! ‚Äú@USAirways: @__RWG__ We don't have those powers in here. We hope you can make that flight.‚Äù"
0,@USAirways Everyone is sorry.  Don't have what I need for meeting tomorrow.  140 charac. isn't nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings
0,@USAirways is the worst. I have to pay $200 just to NOT take my first flight in a round trip! Otherwise they'll Cancelled Flight my whole flight.
0,"@USAirways if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer?  #disappointed"
0,@USAirways terrible service
0,"@USAirways Disgusted with your poor customer service. U wrongfully remove &gt; 65,000 miles from my Dividend Miles and no live person,"
0,@USAirways Please hold flight US 639 in Phoenix! I'm a weary traveler stuck on another flight because the tarmac is having issues!
0,"@USAirways - No live person to speak with all day at Dividend Miles, after they wrongfully took over 65,000 miles out of my account."
0,@USAirways my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences Late Flightly. Currently lost luggage. I want to talk to a real person.
0,"@USAirways cust svc means nothing! So disappointed. Trying since 730a to speak to a human I get bad weather not bad service.

0,@USAirways you are the actual worst.  You have zero respect for your passengers. I'm officially done flying with you.
0,@USAirways has the worst customer service line.  I've called them 8 times today and not once was I able to talk to a real human being.
0,@usairways that wasn't the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won't let me process my request. SMH
0,@USAirways you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this.
0,@USAirways ... I f@$%ing hate you.
0,@USAirways travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund
0,"@USAirways Yes &amp; have already spent 1K+ on the card &amp; paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --&gt; ATL"
0,@USAirways no i use to skyscanner and travel agency and i called u . You said you should call travel agency but
0,"@USAirways finally spoke with someone. I have to email the refund dept. I love you guys, but 6 hours in line to be told no dice sucks."

0,@USAirways I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain  it's no wonder you had to sell
0,"@USAirways hi, Im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. The phone keeps disconnecting. Please advise. Website wont allow."
0,@USAirways did a pre schooler develop your app? The thing crashes every single time.
0,@USAirways and @FlyKnoxville - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #NoClothesNoInfo
0,@USAirways On hold for going on 40 minutes after spending 10 hours delayed in Denver cause of a broken plane. Thanks guys.
0,@USAirways #FAILINGYOURCUSTOMER ONE BY ONE
0,@USAirways @PhilaCarService looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours Late Flight? Seriously?
0,@USAirways. Yet another delay/missed connection....and your customer service has an attitude with me? Wow.
0,"@USAirways 1,223.22 of unusable funds. Will not book with you again. #usairwaysfailscustomers"
1,@USAirways @AmericanAir Can you bring guinea pigs in small pet carrier onboard your flights?
0,@USAirways #NoService good luck trying to reach a human!  Twice sat on hold for over 50 mins...  #neveragain
0,@USAirways every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola.
0,@USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening
1,@USAirways good work by flight 1798 crew.  #Chairman's recognition even in coach.  Too many #missedupgrades Late Flightly.  What's up with this?
0,@USAirways changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to @Delta now &amp; having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never.
0,@USAirways I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best
0,@USAirways sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways.
0,@USAirways It's very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don't answer the phone
0,@USAirways I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help
0,@USAirways I have better Intel than she does!  She said plane is due in at 630.  Flightaware and your own app say 645
0,"@USAirways not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn't departed."
0,"Too little, too Late Flight. You suck RT @USAirways: @mitchsunderland Oh no, Mitchell. Our agents are happy to offer you available options."
0,"@USAirways should, but didn‚Äôt."
0,@USAirways i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again
0,@USAirways seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible
0,@USAirways I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip
0,@USAirways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.
0,@USAirways very embarrassing.
0,@USAirways I‚Äôm still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn‚Äôt up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
0,@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... üòâ what about the impossible connection that started this?
0,@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs
0,@USAirways and despite tailwind‚Ä¶ Will still be Late Flight.
0,@USAirways 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD
1,@USAirways Thanks! Sent you DM re: baggage issues.
0,"@USAirways i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them."
0,@USAirways and yet the Flight Attendant argued with me over Exec Plat benefits...
0,@USAirways please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS http://t.co/AUrn07pWD4
0,@USAirways  has me on my toes whether I'm going to make my flight back to Boston tonight
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir need to check candy w working flight 449 iah to phx on usairways she is the reason I always choose @Delta #rude
0,"@USAirways Yes, ground crew finally showed up so plane could depart very Late Flight."
0,"@USAirways #686 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on #521 to SEA, leaving the same time this arrives. Is there a chance to hold?"
0,@USAirways is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.
0,"@USAirways @Gregm528 well there is certainly nothing happening ""in front"" of the scenes. #Noaccountability  #disappointing"
0,@USAirways 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can't get a response after a week. Unacceptable
1,@USAirways customer service at its best! Rachel S.  took great care of us at the PHX airport. http://t.co/HG7vEqhGHy
0,@USAirways  I will never fly us airways again.
0,@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays
0,@USAirways so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail
0,"@USAirways yes, thanks but took forever"
0,@USAirways as far as being delayed goes‚Ä¶ Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news!
0,@USAirways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05
0,"@USAirways I asked if that was SOP, and they said ‚ÄúIt is now.‚Äù But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not?"
0,@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.
0,@USAirways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 &amp; being argued with.
0,@USAirways I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice.
0,.@USAirways Have you just given up?
0,.@USAirways and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME.
0,@USAirways Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA)
0,"@USAirways Your ""moveup"" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am..."
1,Great management of @USAirways twitter account. Thank you.
0,@USAirways why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app?

0,"@USAirways do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted, this is getting old. Update fleet pls!"
0,@USAirways And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat
0,@USAirways patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time.

1,@USAirways I'll check it out when I get to the airport. Thanks.
0,@USAirways ticket counter people here are not helping and just want to charge more money even after this horrible day.
0,@USAirways - HA! flight to CTL delayed! Going to miss connection. Can you please transfer me to another airline asap? http://t.co/1XdLbiBClP
1,"@USAirways thanks for the reply. On a good note, the pilot nailed the landing. Seriously. Kudos."
0,@USAirways on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn't offered.  Awful service continues.
0,@USAirways I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines.
0,"@USAirways I checked in ""Standby for 1st Class"" only to find I am ""not on the list"". This merger is a pain."
1,@USAirways 4 great flights with no delays! Thank you!
0,@USAirways been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous
0,@USAirways Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now.
0,@USAirways honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600?????
0,@USAirways only happened because u couldn't get us home the next day. #flydelta #flysouthwest #flyjetblue #theyareallbetter #stillnobags

1,@USAirways look out for flying rocks this time! It's a bird it's a plane! Nah never mind it's just a rock...
0,"@USAirways even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me."
0,@USAirways you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them
0,@USAirways this is no way to treat women.  I want someone to contact me and explain how they will make this acceptable.
0,@USAirways citizen. I fly your airline constantly and am so offended.  Derrick Bussey. Now Im crying on this airplane because I'm so upset
0,@USAirways @united really know how to leave someone stranded after a funeral. Props to you guys. Really making this the perfect Monday.

0,@USAirways is okay for u 2 Cancelled Flight change a flight when good 4 u but you cant logistically figure out what 2 do when a plane comes in on time
0,@USAirways Thanks but when I asked for a change with no cost for you the only desition was nade by computer. Now is Late Flight
0,@USAirways if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don't like being told how lousy your service is.
0,@USAirways you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before.
0,@USAirways cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors &amp; corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx.

0,@USAirways just an FYI I'll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got.
0,@USAirways you guys Cancelled Flightled two of my flights yesterday and I checked the bag to Huntsville and it went missing in Philly.
0,"@USAirways customer service failure aside, one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. I'm sure TSA would."
0,@USAirways I find it funny that @PHLAirport responds but you don't. Your customer service is the worst. #wedontcarebecauseyoupaidalready
0,@USAirways I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short
0,@USAirways our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to 1st class. Can you help? Phones are down.
0,@USAirways I need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm  I had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today.
0,@USAirways @CLTDouglas slowest baggage claim ever

0,@USAirways too Late Flight.
0,@USAirways delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that's true I never want to fly US Airways again
1,@USAirways @AmericanAir shout out to Diane at EYW for helping get us home today instead of tomorrow (even if a little Late Flight!)
1,@USAirways made it! Just! Huge relief - thanks for your help!
0,@USAirways how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that?

0,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Arrive 7 hrs Late Flight; checked car seat missing. No replacement available. Has yet to arrive more than 24 hours Late Flightr.
0,@USAirways you guys lost my luggage
0,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Kim Y says: leaving on 15 minutes once paperwork is done. Wheels up ~ 1.5 hours Late Flightr.
0,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances.
0,"@USAirways @marvinatorsb thnk you for response,all flights were full, couldn't get out until tmrw, had to Cancelled Flight and go w/other airline"
0,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen!
0,@USAirways thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable
0,@USAirways How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x
0,@USAirways US 728. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment.
0,"@USAirways US 728. Nope, not getting off. 3 hours in the plane. 4 pilot announcements. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles."
0,"@USAirways US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us."
0,"@USAirways US 728 returned to gate to get ""MEL"" sticker. Oh, look. We heard from pilot! No clue what an MEL sticker is. Anyone?"
0,@USAirways I spent an hour on the phone with them and got no where at all
0,"@USAirways US 728 then lost ground power three different times. Not only grounded endlessly; now without air, lights, entertainment."
0,"@USAirways US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of concern for all aboard."
0,@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.
0,@USAirways Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I've ever been in.  No leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq
0,@USAirways One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won't be any good publicity...
0,"@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. Umm, ok. A little strange."
0,@USAirways my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing
0,"@USAirways can I speak to a human with some compassion? I wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic ""sorry"" email back"
0,"@USAirways take a look at 1715. All F seats filled, so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules."
0,@USAirways back in line at terminal because phone guy couldn't help.  One person in front of me 20 min wait again? http://t.co/HQHdAD7fvK
0,@USAirways So you understand why I'm resorting to Twitter: No help available at  gate while this occurred or by phone afterward.
0,@USAirways going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on US5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please!
0,"@USAirways, I'm expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box."
0,"@USAirways what's the deal with flight 5268 from DCA to PHL? We boarded on time, left the gate a few mins Late Flight and are now sat on Tarmac?"
0,@USAirways stranding a student trying to get to Birmingham in CLT overnight w/o any help.  You can do better than that.  @av_duffy
0,"@usairways really need help asap, so please make it quick. Thx."

0,@usairways hi. You lost my father's wheelchair. Every time we call we just get voicemail. My dad needs it to go home. Please DM me.
0,"@USAirways 4 segments, 4/4 delayed. Gnv &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; JAN . JAN &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; GNV. My year off from flying with you guys was the way to go."
0,@USAirways is charging me $200 to NOT take my flight. Lol. That is the last time I fly with them.
0,@USAirways yes. It says bag is being delivered. The local number says Not Open. Asked main # for cust service got hung up on.
0,"@usairways Row 16, flight 634 today if you're looking for specifics! I can run to Home Depot for the WD40 you if you need."
0,@USAirways seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground!
0,"@USAirways I would happily wait in the terminal near food, restrooms and non irritated passengers."
0,@USAirways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp; the pilot doesn't know when we'll leave.
0,@USAirways anyone there to help? Still on hold...
0,@USAirways oh yay! Now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest.
0,@USAirways site shows on-time but FlightAware site shows delayed. Trying to decide if I get out in this ice to catch FLT 456 to PHX.
0,@USAirways is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given.
0,"@USAirways flights &amp; ""customer relations"" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE"
0,@USAirways sitting here in PHL with all of your rude Customer Service Agents!

0,@USAirways now on hold with customer care.  Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm.
0,@USAirways when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information.
0,@USAirways lots of fun to be removed from top of a list and manually readded to the bottom thanks to club agents. Thanks a lot Asha at DCA.
0,@USAirways your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time.
1,@USAirways Wow unbelievable how you treat your customers at Puerto Rico airport! üëç
0,"@USAirways usually ""sorry"" doesn't involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that's a club perk."
0,@USAirways don't worry. Used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me
0,@USAirways nice try at the gate making traveler after traveler put bags in the size guide because you oversold.  Sorry #minefits
0,"@USAirways horrible service, wrong plane arrived, many confirmed passengers could not get on flight we paid for due to lack of seats flight"
0,"@USAirways booked flight 1mnth ago, seat CONFIRMED, small plane arrived and was not allowed to board bcs no seat, horrible service"

1,"@USAirways okay, great. Thank you!"
0,@USAirways now my rebooked connection is delayed.
0,@USAirways I am in meetings in California and have no luggage!!
0,@USAirways And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered?
0,@USAirways any way to get your call center to answer for a OneWorld award? Whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold
0,@USAirways Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online?
0,@USAirways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail
0,@USAirways how long for a reply
1,@USAirways it was customer service like I have never seen before!  Kudos to your organization.
0,@USAirways Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways
0,@USAirways how do I get a hold of customer service? I've called multiple times &amp; have been on hold for 30+ mins only to have to hang up
0,@USAirways is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I've been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days
0,@USAirways I called the number and they said no one is available to take my call...guys this is insane
0,.@USAirways Can't book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help?
0,"@USAirways / @AmericanAir was the worst experience I've ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time"

0,@USAirways Like I thought this was America.  When did US Airways start operating under the rules of communist Russia?
0,@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
0,@USAirways But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on.
0,@USAirways I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight.

0,"@USAirways u would think if u were going to Cancelled Flight my flight, you'd rebook our seats to something other than the last row. #usairwaysfail"

0,@USAirways dealing w fam emergency. Was told was rebooked this am to AA flight 4297 out of ORD and now it's not in system. Need help ASAP.
1,"@USAirways Got it, thanks!"
0,"@USAirways Umm, can you define 'extra time'?"
0,"@USAirways Oh yes, because I had loads of time running to my connecting flight after you delayed me for about 90 minutes..."
0,"@USAirways Hey, my bag was damaged flying with you yesterday. What can I do?"
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir flight 849's four subsequent delays destroyed my travel plans this evening. Looking to resolve this matter.
0,@USAirways I did at 7 pm! Still no bag..
1,@USAirways Just spoke with a representative. Moved my flight earlier. Thank you so much for the follow up.
0,"@USAirways Congrats, you've just lost a customer for good. When I made a United weather change, free/5 min. You guys 2 hrs on hold &amp; $25."
0,@USAirways So when was I supposed to call the Internet Desk? Especially since my reservation told me to directly call the main 1-800 number?
0,@USAirways Not only did u lose the flight plan! Now ur flight crew is FAA timed out! Thx for havin us sit on the tarmac for an hr! #Pathetic
0,@USAirways I've been on hold for 75 minutes waiting to talk to someone about my flight tomorrow. Is there another number to call?
0,@USAirways ...YOU ARE DESPICABLE! The flight plan was lost! Now we've been sitting on the tarmac for an hour! Its a 45 min flight!
1,@USAirways hey guys just want to say I had the best flight ever! Thank you so much. I fell asleep and actually had a wet dream.
0,@USAirways Can you help me update KTN on the profile?  Ticket book via AA &amp; that info didn't get pass on.  I've been on hold forever
0,@USAirways so you're not honoring miles with @united that were traveled last year?
0,@USAirways I was eventually given a flight to Memphis but only after I was taken off my original flight bc I was checked in as my father
0,@USAirways How the heck does one get the Internet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour?
0,@USAirways so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards
0,"@USAirways &gt;250k miles on usair.  Last four flights not good. Other airlines much improved. Billing issues, seats, legroom, in air service."
0,"@USAirways It says to call. Before connecting, get song, dance about weather. Weather bad 3 days? Called for 2 days before. #wasteoftime"
0,@USAirways REALLY? Tried that already-got message not available to do. Next idea?
0,@USAirways I'm glad you're sorry that I'm homeless for the night. Makes me feel secure.
0,@USAirways but in the meantime I'll be sleeping on a park bench on dadeland st.  Thanks guys!
0,@USAirways wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup
0,"@USAirways but wait! They are booked, along with all other hotels nearby. I was sent anyway, to the hotel managers disbelief."
1,"@USAirways but don't worry! They found a hotel, it's only 45min away. I got there around 11:30pm, no problem."
0,@USAirways at which point in told they have sold my voucher because I wasn't fast enough
0,"@USAirways the kind gentleman at the gate tells me to ""go left"" to get my hotel voucher at the ticket gate. Took about 20min to get there"
0,@USAirways I have a story for you. It starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in Miami.
0,@USAirways -doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect? You be on hold for 2hrs &amp; then zip
0,@USAirways flight scheduled for 730pm...told at 150am that flight is Cancelled Flightled after sitting on cold plane for 2 hours.
0,@USAirways refuses to compensate passengers when inconvenienced and wouldn't even rebook me on another airline. #disappointed
0,@USAirways Can you tell me why I waited 90 mins and then was charged the $25 phone change fee even tho I wasn't allow to make change online?
0,@USAirways @stephenrodrick Your team needs to build capacity
0,@USAirways I will write CR. Not sure what good it'll do as the customer service I experienced was horrible.
0,@USAirways -1st x told no travel advisory-now TWO hrs on hold &amp; disconnected. Fl from BHM to Charlotte to PHL won't go-HELP!!!

0,@USAirways worst customer service I've ever experienced. I'll never fly your airline ever again. I have to pay to sleep in Philly. Fuck you.
0,@USAirways Ever sit on hold and just lose track of time? http://t.co/Yqhk8LJaBN
0,@USAirways us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ?
0,"@usairways now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather?"
0,"@USAirways - the worst! Hold time crazy, agents horrible, no accountability! #USAIRsucks"
1,@USAirways Kudos to Robin at @PHXSkyHarbor Lost/Found for reuniting me w/ my iPad. She was delightful to work with!

0,@USAirways only sympathy she offered was holding a reservation until Monday night. That's pretty awesome if you ask me...
0,@USAirways express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a Sailor dealing with a death in the family
0,@USAirways talked to Supervisor Jeanine and she couldn't help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing.
0,@USAirways i thought @united was the worst airline but nah. You guys are far worse. Is @Delta the only decent airline out there?

0,@USAirways still waiting #brokenpromises #notnice #neveragain #tellyourstory

0,@USAirways rudest crew member experience! Throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir terminal E in Miami is still the worst most smelly airport ever. Thanks for nothing.

0,@USAirways you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn't even until June.
0,"@USAirways will do.  maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 min short of 3 hours, so I guess there are none offered"
0,"@USAirways yep, check it and my gmail 'Promotions' folder regularly... :-("
0,@USAirways thanks for nothing

0,"@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!"
0,"@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service"
0,@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
0,@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
1,@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
0,@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
0,@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
0,@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
0,@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
0,@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
0,@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
0,@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
0,@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
0,@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
1,@USAirways Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.
0,@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
0,@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
0,@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.
0,@USAirways hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days
0,@USAirways Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH
0,@USAirways ordered a Scotch &amp; water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that????
0,"@USAirways yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we're an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today."
0,@USAirways we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class.
0,"@USAirways Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard"
0,@USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off
0,"@USAirways you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else"
0,@USAirways #428 delayed due to #frozentoilet #medicalissue #mechanicalissue #dispatchissue We've heard it all! #LetsGo
0,"@USAirways ""Able""? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won't fit overhead?"
0,@USAirways is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue.
0,@USAirways is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections.
0,@USAirways today's flight to Philadelphia.  It's a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it's not even snowing in FL.
0,@USAirways I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven't talked to a human.
0,@USAirways gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston

1,@USAirways thank you for refunding me on my baggage ! really appreciate it
0,@USAirways thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight.
1,@USAirways @AmericanAir I am so going to miss US Airways.  You always provided great service and NEVER LET ME DOWN.
0,@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni
0,.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
0,"@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!"
0,@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
0,@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!
0,"@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical."
0,"@USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service."
1,@USAirways we will...sunday! Just a few days away
0,@USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.
0,@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
0,@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
0,"@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes"
0,@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
0,@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!
1,"‚Äú@USAirways: @jdbwaffles We're excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?‚Äù Spring Break !!!"
0,@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
1,@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. üëå
0,@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
0,"@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice"
1,@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
0,"@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors"
0,@USAirways I‚Äôll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
0,@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks
0,@USAirways worst experience ever with you guys‚Ä¶see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.
0,@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
0,"@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!"
0,"@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."
0,@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
0,@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
0,@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
0,@USAirways doesn't want me to get home
0,"@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?"
0,"@USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!"
0,"@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you."
0,"@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
0,@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
0,@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
0,@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.
0,"@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta"
0,"@USAirways Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection‚Ä¶ Help!"
0,@USAirways the flight that I did not connect to was 1857.
0,@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
0,@USAirways yes .not sure how you guys don't know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
0,"@USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment."
0,@USAirways - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs
0,@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.
0,@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
0,@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
0,"@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??"
0,"@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!"
0,"@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home."
0,"@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded."
1,@USAirways FA attendant on 4553 PHL to PWM tonight was fab!  An asset to your team.  From 1F. Have a great night team!

0,@USAirways flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives???
0,"@USAirways I already HAVE, four times"
0,"@USAirways 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed."
0,@USAirways I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do?
1,"@USAirways I know that, thanks. Evaluate further ;-) ... -Chairman"
0,"@USAirways Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer"
0,@USAirways No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS
0,"@USAirways Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF"
0,@USAirways thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn't need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway
0,"@USAirways I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can't think@of even ONE."
0,@USAirways  #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie
0,@USAirways 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways
0,"@USAirways unable to locate baggage, this is frustrating. All my sons clothes and needs in it. #zfv #yyz #usairways #baggagelost"

0,"@USAirways flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave!"
0,"@USAirways @AskPayPal When will it be marked ""completed"". I'm scared I'm going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded."
0,"@USAirways @AskPayPal completed. If that's the case then why does it still say ""in progress"" on Paypal's website. I reserved on the 13th."
0,"@USAirways Appreciate the calls when flight's delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious &amp; just goes on &amp; on. I vote for texts if practical :)"
0,@USAirways HORRIBLE communication on delayed flight out of LGA!!!! I got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! HORRIBLE
1,@USAirways thank you finally got our bag. Customer services reps were wonderful.
0,@USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.
0,@USAirways never fails to disappoint.
0,@USAirways platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow?
0,@UsAirways  your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500.
0,"@USAirways flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now"
1,@USAirways flight 437 PHX&gt;ORD.  Lead FA Bill is the most professional FA I have seen in 9 years of flying USAir. I have no AB cards. :-(
1,@USAirways I miss you too. Work has taken me out of Philly. I‚Äôve been on flight 1776 from BOS ‚Äî&gt; PHL so many times I should have a res. seat
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!!
0,@USAirways pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn't just be throwing them on the cart.
1,@USAirways no problem.  Things worked out at airport.   Thanks!
0,@USAirways i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues
0,@USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..
1,"@USAirways yes, it's a domestic flight. Thank you!"
1,@USAirways thanks! Made it safely! http://t.co/KCqeBEej7S
0,@USAirways they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today
0,@USAirways tells me to talk to @AmericanAir about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers
0,@USAirways what is the holdup? Should I be looking for another flight?
0,@USAirways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything.
0,@USAirways 4420 delayed further?
0,@USAirways 25+ min. Hung up. Always awful having to call Reservations there.

0,@USAirways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member.
1,"@USAirways - love the changes in the lounge - cheese, veggies, olives in addition to the crackers and snack mix,"
1,@USAirways thanks.  If you have another method also that would be nice.  Appears to be a design flaw
0,@USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something
0,@USAirways please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ
0,@USAirways forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay.
0,"@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!"
0,@USAirways FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND

0,"@USAirways I'm not patient. I'm annoyed. If you can't book this travel online, then you shouldn't make people wait on the phone."

0,@USAirways but you guys switched me and didn't inform me of the chathes
0,"@USAirways worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice"
0,"@USAirways your app is bad, and you should feel bad."
0,@USAirways Still irritated that our well planned and booked return was messed with &amp; with no warning.
0,@USAirways is probably losing a family of world travelers as customers due to broken processes. @AmericanAir I hope you can fix it
0,"@USAirways yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting"
0,@USAirways You will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when I get back home.
0,@USAirways has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir Will you be destroying lives in Eastern @GastonCounty during this lively little event? For profits you will.
0,@USAirways 5 hour cross country morning flight and you have no food? #BadService
0,@USAirways understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn't have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight.
0,@USAirways we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.

0,@USAirways I've called to resolve my dividend miles issue for a week to no avail.  Please advise ASAP.
0,@USAirways they finally answered. They were rude and didn't help me at all.
1,"@USAirways #success made flight , please thank the crew of 556 great time recovery"
1,@USAirways - so far so good this week. SAV to CLT boarded BEFORE the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). Perhaps an on time departure?!

0,@USAirways How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often...
0,@usairways if you could change your name to @southwestair and do what they do...that'd be awesome. Also this plane smells like onion rings.

0,"@AmericanAir Uwon't allow me2make changes online, force me2sit thru excess phone wait times&amp;still insist charging crazy fees. Thats service?"
0,@AmericanAir Requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction.
0,@AmericanAir Horrible service @loganairports. Luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude. Didn't help at all.
0,@AmericanAir That‚Äôs a rather clunky process. Whoever designed that clearly doesn‚Äôt understand e-mail 101.
1,@AmericanAir thanks! Flight 2160 today. Great crew!
0,@AmericanAir Your customer relations dept has one-way e-mail. How is not allowing responses helpful?

0,@AmericanAir needs to get their shit together. 2 counter people &amp; a massive line. People need to catch their flights! http://t.co/4MQFMxeBXt
0,@AmericanAir I know your policy. Just asking for a little kindness due to extenuating circumstances.
0,@AmericanAir the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing.  Just wow
0,@AmericanAir  oh no she left the counter and went downstairs.  Then she told Elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter.
0,"@AmericanAir @Delta Maybe? Long trip, Late Flight night &amp; queues at baggage claims in two terminals, no good. I thought I paid for it 50$ instead."

0,@AmericanAir no; I just expect a higher level of customer service &amp; for the flight crews to give us accurate information
0,@AmericanAir or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was Cancelled Flightled!
0,"@AmericanAir I tried when I landed, but there was no-one there.  I've emailed your customer service twice now who don't seem to care."

0,"@AmericanAir 2284, four hours Late Flightrs and we are finally flying out...too bad I missed my event"
0,@AmericanAir please allow me to speak with someone. A dialogue would solve this issue better and faster than emailing.

0,"@AmericanAir If SNA curfew causes diversion, do you provide transportation from LAX? On AA1237 now, pilot not sure if we have time."

0,@AmericanAir @louprice13 @aacustomerservice. Apology not good enough. 4 planes with mechanical and 9 hours delayed unacceptable.
0,@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
0,@AmericanAir seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. AA knew age of child.

0,@AmericanAir Asked for a waiver of a change fee for flight booked w/in past 24 hrs. Rep was rude. Just told me no. Didn't even try to help!
1,"@AmericanAir thanks.  I actually made it, my connection flight was delayed.  Guess all delays are not a bad thing. http://t.co/XGgCNTco8m"
0,@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
0,@AmericanAir thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami
0,@AmericanAir an hour now waiting on the phone for US Air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. Love the service guys.
0,@AmericanAir I'm here standing at baggage claim waiting for bags FOR OVER AN HOUR at DFW. The gate is 100 feet from here! #nothappy
0,@AmericanAir right so I missed my connection / had a three hour Kay over / then you lost my bag.
0,"@AmericanAir obviously we did see an agent-booked us for tomorrow morning. No hotel, no transportation. #pregnantwithtwins #stranded #angry"
0,@AmericanAir I was suppose to be in FL 4 hours ago. And I'm not. I've been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous

1,"Still thinking, those PJs may have me sold @AmericanAir @momsgoodeats We'd #love to have you on board with us! @MandarinJourney here I come"
0,@AmericanAir how do you refuse a customer who is willing to pay to upgrade when half of your first class is empty
0,@AmericanAir customer service (if you can call it that) refunded my money
0,@AmericanAir im still on hold...
0,@AmericanAir you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? It's because your airline sucks.
0,@AmericanAir Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?!
0,@AmericanAir #customerservice. Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this. Tough to be loyal.

0,@AmericanAir needs an entire customer service overhaul @Delta would never treat its customers with anything less that A1 service
0,@AmericanAir are you guys intentionally trying to lose customers and money?
0,"@AmericanAir why do you continually play the ""according to federal regulations"" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service..."
0,"@AmericanAir thanks, but I had to hire a car in Chicago and drive to MKE. Does that mean I have to go to the airport?????"
1,@AmericanAir the folks at the Executive Platinum desk are great pros.  They understand my displeasure with change fees and switch to SW.
1,@AmericanAir He thanks you. Anything you can do to help. Would any further information help in the process?

0,"@AmericanAir I have been checking consistently, and called multiple times. As a loyal AA customer, I'm disappointed."

0,@AmericanAir it's not about the delay.  It's about the communication.
0,"@AmericanAir would you like any additional details of my issue? Airport, flight, agent name? Or are you happy w/ this automated lip service?"
0,@AmericanAir 3611 was supposed to depart at 5:10pm central.  About ready to close the door at 7:34pm central.

1,"@AmericanAir @maryella_green just received it, actually. Thank you!!!!!!!!!"
0,@AmericanAir have such a bad rep for loosing costumers luggage. I stopped flying them a while back.

0,@AmericanAir @USAirways I've tried to be understanding and let you handle the situation but I guess I was wrong about that
0,@AmericanAir @USAirways over an hour on the phone the best you can tell me is it was sent maybe my bank misplaced it...

0,"@AmericanAir oh I did. All I received back was an email saying "" delays happen"".. Uh huh.."
0,@AmericanAir How do I place it on hold and complete payment? I don't see any way to do that from my reservations page.
0,@AmericanAir Bad weather happens. But not being able to get through to a reservations rep for over 6 hours is just crazy. #frustrated
0,@AmericanAir why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs Cancelled Flightlation policy? Booked yesterday need to Cancelled Flight
0,@AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.
0,"@AmericanAir yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing."
0,@AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane
0,@AmericanAir you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?
0,@AmericanAir stuck at gate Miami to JFK flight 1510. Are we going to get out of here tonight? Very frustrating
0,@AmericanAir I understand they're busy &amp; doing their best. My frustration is an automated call changing my flight w/o allowing me to talk

0,@AmericanAir has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.
0,@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.
0,@AmericanAir how is US4623 going to be on time when they are still deplaning at 4:08? This is BS.
1,@AmericanAir Flight for tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. New one booked. Seats taken care of. Just a tweet to commend you all on the service. Thanks!
0,@AmericanAir instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume
0,@AmericanAir he is at the Boston airport. There is a problem. The agents will not honor the voucher because one number is rubbed out.
0,@AmericanAir I guess it is more BS AirportCardio given you cannot have an on time flight
0,@AmericanAir you should really explain customer service to your gate agent for 1152 at C4. Couldn't be bothered.
0,"@AmericanAir my wife was on a flt from BRO to TUL via DFW that was Cancelled Flighted. Bought an SWA flight to get her home. Partial refund,DM me plz?"

0,"@AmericanAir can lie to you about where your lost bag is, but we are suppose to trust them with our lives thousands of feet in the air..."

1,@AmericanAir Delaney and Shawn at DFW showed exceptional customer service today. Will happily choose AA whenever possible now! Thank you!

0,@AmericanAir Not true!! Stop making excuses! You either overbook or have crappy planes!
0,"@AmericanAir no. Booked seat in Dallas, live in Dallas. Real nice that your gate agent had exit row available told me they weren't available"

0,".@AmericanAir after 50 minutes on hold, and another 30 minutes on the call yes. Going to be pushing it to get to the airport on time now"
0,@AmericanAir your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I'm not paying extra to select a seat.
0,"@AmericanAir why can't you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it's customers?"
0,@AmericanAir from the rude ticket counter employees to forcing my wife on standby and then pushing her down the list.. it was a very bad day

0,@AmericanAir on Feb. 15th your rep gave me the record locator and told me I'd be receiving an email with the itinerary and confirmation.
0,@AmericanAir This entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left.  #customerservice
0,@AmericanAir been on hold to reserve award travel for over 1.5 hrs now. Anyone home?? Or is it a crazy weather issue? http://t.co/cEHrOeurC5
0,@AmericanAir We don't mind the fee! We were told we can't change name on ticket at all.
1,@AmericanAir Thank you!!!! I will be there to pick her up on time.
0,"@AmericanAir the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish, and doesn't reflect the use of a voucher"
1,"@AmericanAir Well, you guys are totally kicking a million pounds of ass. Bar none, the best SM team in the airline industry in my opinion."
0,@AmericanAir Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren't able to accommodate. Thank you.
0,"@AmericanAir After being patient about my ""delayed"" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable!"
0,@AmericanAir I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. Terrible customer service.
0,"@AmericanAir flt 703, sorry scheduled at 545, phl-mia, a totally chaotic, poorly addressed event.  Sent to three gates in the night"
0,@AmericanAir Was told you could only refund me the cost of my original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive)
0,"@AmericanAir Not okay. Since you couldn't put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline."
0,"@AmericanAir Heard back at 7:30 am today, was put on flight tomorrow AM, arriving home at 4 pm. Meaning I'd have to take a 2nd day off work."
0,"@AmericanAir been @ airport 8hrs been told nothing by anyone until now your rep has said ""we are waiting for the mechanics to finish lunch""!"
0,"@AmericanAir, I've tried no less than 8 times today to get in touch with your service desk beginning at 8:30 EST.  I'm having no luck -help!"
0,"@AmericanAir Was put on hold for 5.5 hrs then got a call back at 11:20 pm, only to wait on hold for another hour."
0,@AmericanAir You lost a customer today. Flight today was Cancelled Flightled and I had to find out by calling customer service yesterday.
0,"@AmericanAir Just called regarding my bag, came in yesterday and no one notified more or updated the online record locator #customerservice"
0,@AmericanAir to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows.
1,@AmericanAir thanks
0,@AmericanAir unacceptable. It's clear losing just one customer doesn't matter to American but how many more bankruptcies will it take
0,@AmericanAir will do on another airline that's more accommodating of its customers. Unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply

0,"@AmericanAir, that's not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too"

1,@AmericanAir Kudos to ticket agents for #2224 for making passengers check bags that are too big to fit in overhead.
0,"@AmericanAir but you're not sorry enough to compensate for either the extended time or cost difference to an alternate direct flight, right?"
0,@AmericanAir @hoagy10 how about you stop cutting and pasting apologies and get some additional phone reps to do their jobs

1,@AmericanAir thanks to Jacqueline in CLT for cleaning up @amexserve and @USAirways mess!!! Awesome service
0,@AmericanAir it's not about the weather. It's about the fact that I can't get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back.

0,@AmericanAir 4828 but I just missed it because no one is at the gate to marshall us in so now I have to rent a car &amp; drive 5 hrs. So thanks.
0,@AmericanAir The pilot told us they would release bags as well as offer hotel vouchers. Neither happened.
0,@AmericanAir my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
0,@AmericanAir Hey so I'm very disappointed with my time traveling with you! I've had the worst experience and both times the flight delayed!
0,@AmericanAir 37 minutes??????

0,@AmericanAir You can't even get someone on the phone. Great story for the media.
0,"‚Äú@AmericanAir:  ""Jason, you'll end up missing your connection. Please see our DFW agents for assistance.‚Äù Nope! Hasn't taken off yet, still!"
0,@AmericanAir finally made it to chicago - 13 hours Late Flight.  Did get a $12 food voucher for my wait.about $1per/hr. Never again. Good bye.
0,@AmericanAir instead of putting the burden on your customers do the right thing and get more gate agents.
0,@AmericanAir guys 5350 in dfw  stuck at the gate for half an hour.  Do we pull the slide or what?
0,@AmericanAir plz kys I have been sitting in this plane for an hour I want to leave
0,@AmericanAir after all that weve been through today as a courtesy to not allow a passenger with an oxgen tank sit up there is bad business
0,@AmericanAir Now you've Cancelled Flightled my flight. First a priority ticket bumped and now this. You're losing customers. People are furious.
0,@americanair I finally got someone on the phone so no worries!
0,@AmericanAir it that you say is going to help us? Give me a number to call that isn't a recording w a 2 hour wait time!
0,@AmericanAir ok. Pilots are looking for agents  - they jumped out / FLT 5350 #DFW / this is crazy
0,@AmericanAir no you're not you're trying to book me PAST when i need 2 arrive but you're still selling seats on the day I'm trying 2 travel
0,@AmericanAir because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can't. Who exactly is
0,@AmericanAir you all should really be ashamed. The entire business class cabin is empty and almost all of first class...
0,@AmericanAir You could only get us on a flight 30 minutes before the funeral starts. We're stranded in Dallas w/o luggage for 2 days
0,"@AmericanAir just Cancelled Flightled my 7 am flight tomorrow with out informing me at all today, then booked one in 2 days, and no customer service"
0,"@AmericanAir Thanks - I note some, but not all, flights are Cancelled Flightled - are only some aircraft/runways working out of DFW today/tomorrow?"
0,@AmericanAir we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..
0,@AmericanAir we tried. We are headed to a funeral in Cincinnati and your people didn't even tell us we could get on standby.
0,@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr
0,@AmericanAir i will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. I have never experienced such awful cs ever
0,"@AmericanAir The delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying ""what's the hury,  the plane is not leaving"
0,@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
0,@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault
0,@AmericanAir no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
0,@AmericanAir and let FLT 2350 know I'm coming / gate crew have yet to arrive to let us off FLT 5350 #DFW
0,@AmericanAir you guys should really improve the service experience with your on site personnel. This has been one of the worst experiences.
0,@AmericanAir @Expedia are killing me. Over 3 hours to get NO human to help me.
0,@AmericanAir 1 ticket agent servicing at least 60 people on line. Waiting for an hour and a half and your phones hang up on people.
0,"@AmericanAir yeah, rebooked for tomorrow morning. But extremely disappointed to miss a wedding."

0,@AmericanAir hey flight 5350 in dfw stuck at gate with no gate agent.  Plane full of people missing connections.

0,@AmericanAir - where are my bags? Baggage claim C25 or C26 (flt# 959)?? I can see the plane from here? Why does it take 25 min???
0,"@AmericanAir is there only one call centre? I know it's busy right now, really need to speak to agent not computer"
0,@AmericanAir you guys fail again.. all I need to do is use my voucher for a ticket but I can't do it online #yourphonesystemsucks

0,@AmericanAir dropping the ball. Again. No catering. Plane switch. No gate attendant. 2 hours Late Flight. Really nice.
0,"@AmericanAir my flight from VCP to JFK was delayed and now it has been Cancelled Flighted, what should i do?"
1,@AmericanAir hats off to Admiral Lounge attendant @ YYZ Terminal 3 who gave her banana to our toddler when none avail elsewhere.
0,"@AmericanAir ""We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight"" is ridiculous."
0,"@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!"
1,@AmericanAir I tried that. They won't book us with another airline. I wish I had flown with you! We are now stuck in FL til Weds.
0,"@vanessaannz seriously, you hate @AmericanAir since they can't accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny"
0,@AmericanAir gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven't strtd boarding.
0,@AmericanAir In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can't reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do?
0,@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.
0,@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
0,@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
0,"@AmericanAir I was on flt 2222 tomorrow, they moved me to 750. I need it moved to Tuesday. the roads won't be better for flight 750. thanks"
0,@AmericanAir no other (what should be valid) Circle Pacific itineraries can be booked either - always makes all US dest. invalid 4 last leg
0,@AmericanAir I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don't see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines
0,@AmericanAir you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven't even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet
0,@AmericanAir none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mF7rABGn8a Every last leg back to US says invalid
1,@AmericanAir I'm booked for Tuesday night. 60 degrees in Alabama right now. I'm good. Stay warm and safe.
0,@AmericanAir So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....
0,@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
0,@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
0,"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , to my surprise  BA doesn't  have  me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ?"
0,@AmericanAir Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help?
1,"@AmericanAir Thanks for the reply, but a functioning plane four hours ago was the only way to do that. The staff was friendly, tho."
1,Thank you for sending more details  @AmericanAir: They're pretty handy dandy. more info here: http://t.co/FvlxIRh1F1 #LookforwardtoflywithAA
0,@AmericanAir aa223 being ignored
0,"@AmericanAir FYI twice now I've tried the ""we'll call you when someone is free"" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up."
0,@AmericanAir that's the number I called -it wouldn't let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today
0,@AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F
0,"@AmericanAir @MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time"
0,@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.
0,"@AmericanAir I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault."
0,"@AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane üò¢üòïüò¶ #AmericanAirlines"
0,@AmericanAir is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand
0,@AmericanAir I've never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline.
0,@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my wife's flight and she has to call but your service won't even let us. Going on 7 hours now.
0,@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items
0,@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.
0,@AmericanAir the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet.
1,@AmericanAir @DAI_President Good luck at DFW this evening AA!
0,@AmericanAir so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.
0,"@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting"
1,@AmericanAir Awesome customer service on #390 from rdu. They snuck my wife a warm cookie. Thx!
0,@AmericanAir flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food
0,"@AmericanAir @CineDrones I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful üò≥"
0,"@americanair seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in http://t.co/o3CjsVSsqF"
0,@AmericanAir @carlw1980 I have followed and dm'd you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service.
0,"@AmericanAir  To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am.  I don't like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr.  CS sucks."
0,"@AmericanAir just when I thought you guys were done messing up, you make it worse. Your airline ruins hopes and dreams."
0,@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
0,"@AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight."
0,@AmericanAir makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose
0,@AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.
0,@AmericanAir how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293
0,@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
0,"@americanair Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/uCvEU2hurZ"
0,@AmericanAir the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out
0,@AmericanAir the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293
0,@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
0,"@AmericanAir looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks."
0,@AmericanAir my #Navy sisters flight 2470 cancld. She can't get an agent. They've called her back to be put on hold &amp; then discnct.Any help?
0,@AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y‚Äôall hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
0,@americanair anxious to see how you all care for customers you‚Äôve inconvenienced #Cancelled Flightledflight
0,"@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy."
0,"@AmericanAir Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick ""Goodbye"" Very Sad!"
0,@AmericanAir VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help!
0,@AmericanAir already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back.
0,@AmericanAir you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?
0,"@AmericanAir yes, for tomorrow at 9 am. But I have to work though üòí I'm really mad about the situation"
0,"@AmericanAir whenever I cheat on you it goes horribly wrong! I promise, I won't stray anymore. I'm talking about you @Delta!"
0,"@AmericanAir @praywinn between understaffing, what looks like a labor slowdown, weather, incompetence, and disregard for the customer..."
0,"@AmericanAir I need help with a reservation purchased on @AmericanAir but operated on @USAirways, can't get through on the 800#"
0,@AmericanAir  flight from DFW to LIT tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled.  What do I do next?  Pls advise.  #HELP
0,@AmericanAir how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight!
0,@AmericanAir my flight I have reserved for tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. Can I Cancelled Flight my reservation and get a full refund?
1,@AmericanAir thanks to FA Shawn for spectacular service on FLT 79 LHRDFW and to FA Susan for such a warm engaging onboard welcome
0,@AmericanAir I can't choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH
0,@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
0,"@AmericanAir ""overweight"" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is."
0,@AmericanAir at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF?
0,"@AmericanAir Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled."
0,@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....
1,@AmericanAir I ended up on a flight to LA my fourth time on standby. Thanks! http://t.co/NA5G5EAKPA
0,@AmericanAir been waiting on hold for more than an hour
0,@AmericanAir thanks. Now my carry on that you guys insisted be checked at the gate is missing. Won't be here till Late Flight tomorrow morning.
1,"@AmericanAir that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses."
0,@AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.
1,@AmericanAir thanks for the show! üëç
0,"@AmericanAir well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel @PHLAirport"
1,@AmericanAir no worries even though I was talking about seat assignment :)
0,"@AmericanAir Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!"
0,"@AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits"
0,"@AmericanAir , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous @PHLAirport"
0,@AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
0,@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
1,@AmericanAir Great seats on this aircraft!
0,Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one planeüò°
0,@AmericanAir AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal!
0,@AmericanAir a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on!
0,@AmericanAir The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles.
0,@AmericanAir we have 3 more passengers with me   There are two more reservation numbers
0,"@AmericanAir @PatrichRuben no, profit maximization is your top priority. Nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs"
0,"@AmericanAir @manuel_c ""here for you"" as in, yeah, we'll tweet platitudes at you so you'll think our Twitter bot cares? Or...."
0,@AmericanAir #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded.
0,@AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful
0,"@AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got"
1,@AmericanAir DONE!! thank you so much!!
0,@AmericanAir Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/YPVPVdlTYs
0,@AmericanAir then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool &amp; untrue
0,@AmericanAir 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I've landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this.
0,"@AmericanAir delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS"
0,"@AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?"
0,@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.
1,@AmericanAir everything's good now brothaaaaaa
0,@AmericanAir its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired
0,@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.
0,@AmericanAir OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK
0,@AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with
0,"@AmericanAir 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally!"
0,"@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots"
0,@AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap
0,@AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!
0,@AmericanAir yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please
0,@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth
0,@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded
0,@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
0,@AmericanAir we need a miracle @slcairport please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids
0,@AmericanAir i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning!
0,@AmericanAir finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure?
0,@AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?
0,"@AmericanAir i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?"
0,@AmericanAir Close down
1,@AmericanAir it was 1265 coming and next catching 2396 home to DCA. Let's get another great leg too tonight!
1,@AmericanAir i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.
0,@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
0,@AmericanAir I‚Äôve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
0,@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
0,@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
0,@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
0,@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
0,@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
0,@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
0,@AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!
0,@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
0,@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
0,@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.
0,@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
0,@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
0,@AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
0,@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
0,@AmericanAir Hi AA friends! My sis's flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options?
0,@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
0,@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
0,@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
0,@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
0,@AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go?
0,@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
0,@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
0,"@AmericanAir I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz."
0,@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting
